This intracellular pathogen uses many mechanisms to subvert the host immune system and lie undetected before causing active disease. This subtle pathogen is uniquely dependent on host lipids for energy, production of host-damaging materiel, and immune subversion. In the face of antibiotic-resistant Mtb strains, researchers have turned toward lipid biology for potential avenues of novel antitubercular therapy. The sphingolipid family has gained attention for its profound roles in determining cell fate, immune signaling, and antimicrobial activity. We review the state of the field regarding sphingolipids as candidate targets of host-directed antitubercular intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 3\n\n\nBreaking and Entering: Sphingomyelin Biosynthesis Is Essential for Phagocytic Signaling during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Host Cell Entry\n\n\nPhagocytosis by alveolar macrophages is the obligate first step in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, yet the mechanism underlying this process is incompletely understood. Here we show that Mtb invasion relies on an intact sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition or knockout of early sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes greatly reduces Mtb uptake across multiple phagocytic cell types without affecting other forms of endocytosis. While the phagocytic receptor Dectin-1 undergoes normal clustering at the pathogen contact sites, sphingolipid biosynthetic mutant cells fail to segregate the regulatory phosphatase CD45 from the clustered receptors. Blocking sphingolipid production also impairs downstream activation of Rho GTPases, actin dynamics, and phosphoinositide turnover at the nascent phagocytic cup. Moreover, we find that production of sphingomyelin, not glycosphingolipids, is essential for Mtb uptake. Collectively, our data support a critical role of sphingomyelin biosynthesis in an early stage of Mtb infection and provide novel insights into the mechanism underlying phagocytic entry of this pathogen.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 4\n\n\nSealing the Gaps: Sphingolipids are essential for repairing the endosomal damage caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\n\nTuberculosis infection remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, causing over 1.3 million deaths in 2022 alone. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), there is a pressing need for novel and improved therapeutics. Here, we characterize the critical role of sphingolipids in restricting intracellular replication of Mtb. Sphingolipids are essential for rapidly responding to membrane damage and maintaining lysosomal integrity during Mtb infection. Additionally, sphingolipids enable the restriction of Mtb growth within host cells. Understanding the influence of host sphingolipids on Mtb infection may reveal novel routes for host-directed therapy. This research provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of Mtb infection and could pave the way for developing new therapeutic strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 5\n\n\nLiving Off the Fat of the Cell: A lipidomics map of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected cell\n\n\nFor centuries, humans have been seeking reliable treatment for tuberculosis, but unfortunately, it still poses a significant threat to global health. Recent research has shown that host lipid biology may offer new opportunities for developing novel antitubercular therapy. Here, we identify unique signatures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection by comparing the global lipidome of cells infected with pathogenic and attenuated Mtb strains against the lipidomes of cells treated with isolated Mtb cell wall components. We find that pathogenic and attenuated infections and treatments with pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce significant upregulation of diacylglycerol production. However, only pathogenic infection increases the production of triacylglycerol and acylcarnitine, reflecting induced fatty acid β-oxidation, while inhibiting the synthesis of lysophospholipids and plasmalogens, which reflects concerted subversions of the macrophage antimicrobial program. This research shows great potential in identifying potential host-directed therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 6\n\n\nAn Affinity for Sphingolipids: Trifunctional lipid probes reveal protein-sphingolipid interactions during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection\n\n\nUnderstanding the molecular interactions underlying Mtb’s capacity for immune subversion and hijacking of the host cell can provide a unique insight into potential new routes of antitubercular therapy. Because Mtb is a pathogen with a unique sensitivity to the host lipid compartment, and because sphingolipids are a lipid family with emerging roles in regulating antimicrobial functions in macrophages, we sought to characterize the sphingolipid interactome of an Mtb-infected cell. To this end, we utilized trifunctionalized lipid analogs as affinity handles for enrichment proteomics. We found that Mtb infection induces a significant reprogramming of proteins that interact with sphingosine. These changes included a downregulation of interactions among proteins involved in secretory trafficking and lysosomal maturation and an upregulation of interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. We further identify a candidate Mtb protein that selectively interacts with trifunctional sphingosine. This analysis is the first of its kind and represents a crucial step in characterizing how sphingolipids mediate the cellular response to intracellular infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 7\n\n\nGenetic tools to study sphingolipids in disease\n\n\nSphingolipids are a critical family of membrane lipids with diverse functions in eukaryotic cells, and a growing body of literature supports that these lipids play essential roles during the lifecycles of viruses. While small molecule inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis and metabolism are widely used, the advent of CRISPR-based genomic editing techniques allows for nuanced exploration into the manners in which sphingolipids influence various stages of viral infections. Here we describe some of these critical considerations needed in designing studies utilizing genomic editing techniques for manipulating the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, as well as the current body of literature regarding how viruses depend on the products of this pathway. Here, we highlight the ways in which sphingolipids affect viruses as these pathogens interact with and influence their host cell and describe some of the many open questions remaining in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 8\n\n\nThe Squeaky Yeast Gets Greased: The Roles of Host Lipids in the Clearance of Pathogenic Fungi\n\n\nFungal infections remain a global health threat with high morbidity and mortality. The human immune system must, therefore, perpetually defend against invasive fungal infections. Phagocytosis is critical for the clearance of fungal pathogens, as this cellular process allows select immune cells to internalize and destroy invading fungal cells. While much is known about the protein players that enable phagocytosis, the various roles that lipids play during this fundamental innate immune process are still being illuminated.

Phagocytosis is a complex process that initiates with the binding of the particles on the cell surface of the phagocytes through the interaction of pattern recognition receptors with ligands on the surface of the pathogens. During this process, phagocytes undergo extensive membrane reorganization and cytoskeleton rearrangement at their cell surface. To gain better insight about the molecular mechanisms of this dynamic cellular process, visualization and quantification in a high-throughput manner is essential. Here, we describe a microscope-based method to visualize and quantify phagocytic uptake of pathogens (such as bacteria and fungi) and model particulates that are larger than 0.5 μm (such as Zymosan A and IgG-coated beads).\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lipid Interactome\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive web tool aggregates the data from a number of publications which utilize synthetic, functionalized lipid analogs to do affinity enrichment in order to identify the protein interactors of select bioactive lipids.\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 25, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

Here we show that Mtb invasion relies on an intact sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition or knockout of early sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes greatly reduces Mtb uptake across multiple phagocytic cell types without affecting other forms of endocytosis. While the phagocytic receptor Dectin-1 undergoes normal clustering at the pathogen contact sites, sphingolipid biosynthetic mutant cells fail to segregate the regulatory phosphatase CD45 from the clustered receptors. Blocking sphingolipid production also impairs downstream activation of Rho GTPases, actin dynamics, and phosphoinositide turnover at the nascent phagocytic cup. Moreover, we find that production of sphingomyelin, not glycosphingolipids, is essential for Mtb uptake.

We find that pathogenic and attenuated infections and treatments with pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce significant upregulation of diacylglycerol production. However, only pathogenic infection increases the production of triacylglycerol and acylcarnitine, reflecting induced fatty acid β-oxidation, while inhibiting the synthesis of lysophospholipids and plasmalogens, which reflects concerted subversions of the macrophage antimicrobial program.

Because Mtb is a pathogen with a unique sensitivity to the host lipid compartment, and because sphingolipids are a lipid family with emerging roles in regulating antimicrobial functions in macrophages, we sought to characterize the sphingolipid interactome of an Mtb-infected cell. To this end, we utilized trifunctionalized lipid analogs as affinity handles for enrichment proteomics. We found that Mtb infection induces a significant reprogramming of proteins that interact with sphingosine. These changes included a downregulation of interactions among proteins involved in secretory trafficking and lysosomal maturation and an upregulation of interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. We further identify a candidate Mtb protein that selectively interacts with trifunctional sphingosine. This analysis is the first of its kind and represents a crucial step in characterizing how sphingolipids mediate the cellular response to intracellular infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 7\n\n\nGenetic tools to study sphingolipids in disease\n\n\nSphingolipids are a critical family of membrane lipids with diverse functions in eukaryotic cells, and a growing body of literature supports that these lipids play essential roles during the lifecycles of viruses.

Here we describe some of these critical considerations needed in designing studies utilizing genomic editing techniques for manipulating the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, as well as the current body of literature regarding how viruses depend on the products of this pathway.

The human immune system must, therefore, perpetually defend against invasive fungal infections. Phagocytosis is critical for the clearance of fungal pathogens, as this cellular process allows select immune cells to internalize and destroy invading fungal cells. While much is known about the protein players that enable phagocytosis, the various roles that lipids play during this fundamental innate immune process are still being illuminated. In this review, we describe recent discoveries that shed new light on the mechanisms by which host lipids enable the phagocytic uptake and clearance of fungal pathogens.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 9\n\n\nRapid visualization and quantification of phagocytosis in neutrophils\n\n\nPhagocytosis by phagocytes such as neutrophils is a crucial part of the host innate immune response against invading pathogens. Phagocytosis is a complex process that initiates with the binding of the particles on the cell surface of the phagocytes through the interaction of pattern recognition receptors with ligands on the surface of the pathogens. During this process, phagocytes undergo extensive membrane reorganization and cytoskeleton rearrangement at their cell surface. To gain better insight about the molecular mechanisms of this dynamic cellular process, visualization and quantification in a high-throughput manner is essential. Here, we describe a microscope-based method to visualize and quantify phagocytic uptake of pathogens (such as bacteria and fungi) and model particulates that are larger than 0.5 μm (such as Zymosan A and IgG-coated beads).\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 10\n\n\nSystematic analysis of the sphingomyelin synthase family in C. elegans\n\n\nSphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of mammalian cell membranes and particularly abundant in the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. Its production is catalyzed by SM synthases SMS1 and SMS2, which interconvert phosphatidylcholine and ceramide to diacylglycerol and SM in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane, respectively. As the lipids participating in this reaction fulfill both structural and signaling functions, SMS enzymes have considerable potential to influence diverse important cellular processes. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model for studying both animal development and human disease. The organism contains five SMS homologues but none of these have been characterized in any detail. Here, we carried out the first systematic analysis of SMS family members in C. elegans. Using heterologous expression systems, genetic ablation, metabolic labeling and lipidome analyses, we show that C. elegans harbors at least three distinct SM synthases and one ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) synthase.

This intracellular pathogen uses many mechanisms to subvert the host immune system and lie undetected before causing active disease. This subtle pathogen is uniquely dependent on host lipids for energy, production of host-damaging materiel, and immune subversion. In the face of antibiotic-resistant Mtb strains, researchers have turned toward lipid biology for potential avenues of novel antitubercular therapy. The sphingolipid family has gained attention for its profound roles in determining cell fate, immune signaling, and antimicrobial activity. We review the state of the field regarding sphingolipids as candidate targets of host-directed antitubercular intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 3\n\n\nBreaking and Entering: Sphingomyelin Biosynthesis Is Essential for Phagocytic Signaling during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Host Cell Entry\n\n\nPhagocytosis by alveolar macrophages is the obligate first step in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, yet the mechanism underlying this process is incompletely understood. Here we show that Mtb invasion relies on an intact sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition or knockout of early sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes greatly reduces Mtb uptake across multiple phagocytic cell types without affecting other forms of endocytosis. While the phagocytic receptor Dectin-1 undergoes normal clustering at the pathogen contact sites, sphingolipid biosynthetic mutant cells fail to segregate the regulatory phosphatase CD45 from the clustered receptors. Blocking sphingolipid production also impairs downstream activation of Rho GTPases, actin dynamics, and phosphoinositide turnover at the nascent phagocytic cup. Moreover, we find that production of sphingomyelin, not glycosphingolipids, is essential for Mtb uptake. Collectively, our data support a critical role of sphingomyelin biosynthesis in an early stage of Mtb infection and provide novel insights into the mechanism underlying phagocytic entry of this pathogen.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 4\n\n\nSealing the Gaps: Sphingolipids are essential for repairing the endosomal damage caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\n\nTuberculosis infection remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, causing over 1.3 million deaths in 2022 alone. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), there is a pressing need for novel and improved therapeutics. Here, we characterize the critical role of sphingolipids in restricting intracellular replication of Mtb. Sphingolipids are essential for rapidly responding to membrane damage and maintaining lysosomal integrity during Mtb infection. Additionally, sphingolipids enable the restriction of Mtb growth within host cells. Understanding the influence of host sphingolipids on Mtb infection may reveal novel routes for host-directed therapy. This research provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of Mtb infection and could pave the way for developing new therapeutic strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 5\n\n\nLiving Off the Fat of the Cell: A lipidomics map of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected cell\n\n\nFor centuries, humans have been seeking reliable treatment for tuberculosis, but unfortunately, it still poses a significant threat to global health. Recent research has shown that host lipid biology may offer new opportunities for developing novel antitubercular therapy. Here, we identify unique signatures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection by comparing the global lipidome of cells infected with pathogenic and attenuated Mtb strains against the lipidomes of cells treated with isolated Mtb cell wall components. We find that pathogenic and attenuated infections and treatments with pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce significant upregulation of diacylglycerol production. However, only pathogenic infection increases the production of triacylglycerol and acylcarnitine, reflecting induced fatty acid β-oxidation, while inhibiting the synthesis of lysophospholipids and plasmalogens, which reflects concerted subversions of the macrophage antimicrobial program. This research shows great potential in identifying potential host-directed therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 6\n\n\nAn Affinity for Sphingolipids: Trifunctional lipid probes reveal protein-sphingolipid interactions during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection\n\n\nUnderstanding the molecular interactions underlying Mtb’s capacity for immune subversion and hijacking of the host cell can provide a unique insight into potential new routes of antitubercular therapy. Because Mtb is a pathogen with a unique sensitivity to the host lipid compartment, and because sphingolipids are a lipid family with emerging roles in regulating antimicrobial functions in macrophages, we sought to characterize the sphingolipid interactome of an Mtb-infected cell. To this end, we utilized trifunctionalized lipid analogs as affinity handles for enrichment proteomics. We found that Mtb infection induces a significant reprogramming of proteins that interact with sphingosine. These changes included a downregulation of interactions among proteins involved in secretory trafficking and lysosomal maturation and an upregulation of interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. We further identify a candidate Mtb protein that selectively interacts with trifunctional sphingosine. This analysis is the first of its kind and represents a crucial step in characterizing how sphingolipids mediate the cellular response to intracellular infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 7\n\n\nGenetic tools to study sphingolipids in disease\n\n\nSphingolipids are a critical family of membrane lipids with diverse functions in eukaryotic cells, and a growing body of literature supports that these lipids play essential roles during the lifecycles of viruses. While small molecule inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis and metabolism are widely used, the advent of CRISPR-based genomic editing techniques allows for nuanced exploration into the manners in which sphingolipids influence various stages of viral infections. Here we describe some of these critical considerations needed in designing studies utilizing genomic editing techniques for manipulating the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, as well as the current body of literature regarding how viruses depend on the products of this pathway. Here, we highlight the ways in which sphingolipids affect viruses as these pathogens interact with and influence their host cell and describe some of the many open questions remaining in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 8\n\n\nThe Squeaky Yeast Gets Greased: The Roles of Host Lipids in the Clearance of Pathogenic Fungi\n\n\nFungal infections remain a global health threat with high morbidity and mortality. The human immune system must, therefore, perpetually defend against invasive fungal infections. Phagocytosis is critical for the clearance of fungal pathogens, as this cellular process allows select immune cells to internalize and destroy invading fungal cells. While much is known about the protein players that enable phagocytosis, the various roles that lipids play during this fundamental innate immune process are still being illuminated. In this review, we describe recent discoveries that shed new light on the mechanisms by which host lipids enable the phagocytic uptake and clearance of fungal pathogens.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 9\n\n\nRapid visualization and quantification of phagocytosis in neutrophils\n\n\nPhagocytosis by phagocytes such as neutrophils is a crucial part of the host innate immune response against invading pathogens. Phagocytosis is a complex process that initiates with the binding of the particles on the cell surface of the phagocytes through the interaction of pattern recognition receptors with ligands on the surface of the pathogens. During this process, phagocytes undergo extensive membrane reorganization and cytoskeleton rearrangement at their cell surface. To gain better insight about the molecular mechanisms of this dynamic cellular process, visualization and quantification in a high-throughput manner is essential. Here, we describe a microscope-based method to visualize and quantify phagocytic uptake of pathogens (such as bacteria and fungi) and model particulates that are larger than 0.5 μm (such as Zymosan A and IgG-coated beads).\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 10\n\n\nSystematic analysis of the sphingomyelin synthase family in C. elegans\n\n\nSphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of mammalian cell membranes and particularly abundant in the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers.

    "text": "Assembly\nAs usual, I forgot to take very many pictures while this was a work in progress…\nI started this project by trying to find a way to activate the remote with the ESP32. At first I tried using some input pins on the remote PCB (see the picture below), but I couldn’t get the signal to work properly with these – I think because the voltage going into the “CLK” pinout wasn’t correct.\n\n\n\n\nMy first testing board – not the final wiring schematic\n\n\n\nAfter some testing with a breadboard, I found that the most reliable way to do this was to add a transistor that could close the activation button using a 3.3 V GPIO output signal. Interestingly, I also noticed that this transistor needed an additional load LED going to the ESP32 ground in order to work – which I think suggests that the button typically uses a pull-down resistor?\nMy next step was to start testing the WiFi and MQTT connections so that I could get the ESP32 to publish the door state to my HomeAssistant setup – and to subscribe to a command topic which would allow me to open and close the door on command. I did a lot of testing with the battery removed from the door remote so I didn’t open and close the door 10,000x – instead, I added an extra external button so I could manually trigger the ESP32 to detect an open/close signal. I used the ESP32’s on-board RGB LED as a reporter signal of the WiFi/MQTT connection and the trigger signal (note the bright red signal when I push the button in the video below).\n\n\nAn external button triggers the ESP32 to update an “open”/“closed” boolean which HomeAssistant reads as “Unlocked”/“Locked”. This also works in reverse: triggering a state change in HomeAssistant updates the state onboard the ESP32. However, without an external sensor, the ESP32 has no way to record the real state of the door.\nAn external button triggers the ESP32 to update an “open”/“closed” boolean which HomeAssistant reads as “Unlocked”/“Locked”. This also works in reverse: triggering a state change in HomeAssistant updates the state onboard the ESP32. However, without an external sensor, the ESP32 has no way to record the real state of the door.\n\n\nAdding a Hall effect sensor allows me to detect the true state of the door. I wanted this sensor to be on a long cord so I’d have options on where to mount it – cue me destroying a spare USB-C cable and attaching 3-pin connectors to each end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final ESP32/door remote setup, featuring the can used to build the mount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI next needed to craft a stable mount for this sensor sit close enough to a magnet on the garage door. I thought very carefully about my options and decided that an aluminum can would be the perfect source material for this mount. I got out my tin snips, a metal ruler, and some super adhesive mounting tape to build a little mount. I then drilled some holes in order to screw the Hall effect sensor to the mount and fixed the whole thing to the wall close enough to my magnet to be triggered when the door is closed."

The lamp supports multiple lighting patterns, such as an organic randomized “breathing” pattern and a cascading rainbow.\nI embedded a series of AdaFruit NeoPixels in a series of “mushrooms” consisting of shaped silicone caulk. These mushrooms were installed on a piece of bark (found on a log in my backyard) and made to look as natural as possible. A central dome mushroom contains more NeoPixels and an LED strand that I think looks very cool.\nThe whole project was donated to Becca’s classroom for interactive learning about hobby electronics.\n\n\nFinal product!\nFinal product!"

This function takes arguments for position, red value, green value, blue value, and white value – and then determines which NeoPixel to apply the RGBW value to.\nAt heart, every pattern just applies this light function in different ways. The really tricky part was getting the loop to recognize when the button was pressed. I needed to learn about the Interupt Service Routine, and use it to respond to button presses. A second big challenge came with the discovery that the button I chose had terrible debounce behavior – as is probably obvious in the “final product” video above, the button only registers like 1/3 of the time…\nThere is a global counter that increases with each detected button press (mod arithmetic rolls it back over when the count is &gt;5). This counter feeds into a function that plays the appropriate pattern (setPattern()). Each pattern loops infinitely, but checks the value of the counter at the start of each loop – if the button count is different, the pattern breaks and setPattern() determines which pattern to display next.\nThis was the first project which I broke the config, helper functions, pattern functions, and main setup/loop into separate files – I’ve been struggling with the baby book project because the single-file organization is difficult to navigate! It’s likely that I’ll go back and separate that project out into similar components in the final version."

    "text": "Assembly\n\n\n\n\nTesting the concept of the lamp, with really basic control via the ESP32.\n\n\n\n\nNext, I soldered the LEDs to power lines – I decided to directly integrate the current limiting resistor into the stalk of the mushroom so I wouldn’t be tempted to test the mushrooms without a resistor (a stupid mistake that killed my first test mushroom!).\nI then crafted the mushroom stalks using the silicone caulk: I squirted a line of some caulk out onto some plastic film, added a small amount of dye to make nice colors, and squashed the LEDs into the line. By folding the plastic wrap over and kneading carefully, I got the wires embedded in the center of the caulk and a mostly round cross-section.\n\n\n\n\nDrying the newly-formed caulk stalks! It took a few days for them to feel solid enough to peel the plastic wrap off.\n\n\n\n\nFor the mushroom caps, I squeezed out more caulk and dye to match the LED colors and left them to dry between layers of plastic wrap. I used the tops of bottles and curved things to help them set in the right shape. Once everything dried, I used a big glob of caulk to glue the tops to the bottoms.\nI then drilled 10 mm holes into my log in what I thought would appear to be a natural arrangement and fed the trailing LED leads through and then used more caulk to glue them in place. I also drilled and glued in place the light-dependent resistor near the back of the bark and the bare flickering LED right in the center. I left the underside of the amanita off for the time being – my vision was to make it big enough to cover the board underneath, so it needed to be glued in place as a final step.\nNext I started work on soldering the PCB. The main components here are the ESP32-C3 itself, one NPN2222a transistor for each LED (discussed a little more below), a pull-up resistor for the LDR, and trailing wires to power each LED pointing up away from the board so that they’d be long enough to solder to the trailing wires of the glued-in LEDs (This turned out to be a huge pain).\n\n\n\n\nForgive my terrible soldering, I was still learning and didn’t yet have a flux pen to help guide the solder in place! I also apparently never took a picture of the top…\n\n\n\nThe NPN2222a transistors were my rudimentary attempt at performing level shifting. The GPIO data out voltage is 3.3 V – and in my testing, it made the LEDs just not quite as bright as I wanted them, even after messing around with different resistor levels. I decided to bump them up to 5 V by connecting the Vcc lead to the emitter pin of the transistor, and the GPIO data line connected to the base. This allowed the ESP32 to regulate the apparent brightness of the LED via PWM and increased the maximum brightness with the higher Vcc. A few days after I soldered all my transistors in place, I learned about the 74AHCT125 Level Shifter, which performs the same action with four input/output pin pairs and only one Vcc in and ground connection each; I felt a little bit like a fool for having wasted so much space on a big bulky PCB that could have been so much smaller – but that’s learning!\nSoldering the LEDs to their lead wires was a huge pain. In retrospect, I should have set it up with two-pronged plugs to make them just slot into place. Instead, I had to painstakingly squeeze the hot soldering iron between the PCB and the bark, being careful to not melt anything. It was a many-hours-long struggle and resulted in a huge mess of connections which are super prone to shorting out with small jostles… This was definitely the worst way I could have done it! Big notes to my future self with this!\nAnd finally, I assembled a little log cabin using some sticks and more caulk. My vision didn’t really come to reality – this thing doesn’t look all that good and I still haven’t actually glued it in place because I keep telling myself I’ll make a new one… I should probably just glue it down and call it done though.\n\n\n\nThe final product!\n\n\nI glued the board in place, covered it with the bottom portion of the amanita – and just like that, the physical components of the lamp were done! I next got started making a real light pattern."

    "text": "Code\nThis was my first coding adventure with C++ – I’ll shamefully admit that I asked ChatGPT a lot of questions in order to get me started here, but after a while I started to realize it wasn’t that much more helpful than Googling my question and finding StackOverflow threads.\nPrior to this little project, I haven’t done basically anything with hardware, and it took a lot of learning to understand how to use non-blocking timing patterns to make sure that the lights don’t interfere with each other – and so that the lamp is constantly probing the surrounding light levels.\nIn short, the loop function starts by checking the ambient light – if it’s too light out, the lamp goes into a light sleep mode and checks again a few times each second. If the ambient light is dim enough, it triggers a step in the pattern light function.\nOn boot, each LED is assigned the minimum brightness value, an empty timer, and a random time interval. Using the random time interval, each LED is then assigned a calculated timespan for updating its brightness level. Each time the pattern loop begins, it goes through each LED and assesses whether an appropriate amount of time has passed to either increase or decrease the brightness ([total interval] / [num steps between min and max brightness]) – and if an appropriate amount of time has passed, the LED steps up until it hits the max brightness and then goes down until the minimum brightness. At the minimum brightness, the LED is assigned a new time interval.\nThe goal was to make the mushrooms look like they’re breathing, and I like to think it’s pretty good!\nThe LED inside the cabin flickers to make it seem like a little inhabitant is sitting by the fire. This isn’t directly controlled by the ESP32 – I just stole the LED from an electric candle, so it has a semi-random flickering pattern built into its PCB. The unfortunate side-effect of this is that I cannot control the brightness myself to adjust its pattern, but that’s ok!"

In the future, I would vastly prefer to make the wires coming out of the LEDs much longer and tipped with 2-pin connectors so that they can just plug into the PCB! This would also help protect the lights from shorting to ground so easily…\nThis is an easy fix I just haven’t done yet, but this nightlight has a silly flickering behavior when the ambient light is just barely dark enough to trigger the lamp because the lamp itself provides enough light to turn itself off! This would be fixed by just having two brightness thresholds, the “off” threshold being brightness than the “on” threshold – that way it turns on in relatively dim light and turns off only when it’s substantially brighter. I’ll go back and fix this sometime!\nA slightly more complicated coding fix is to alter the brightness stepping function so that it better matches the perception of the human eye: right now it linearly adjusts the PWM value from min (25) to max (255) – but the eye perceives differences in brightness non-linearly. Someday I’ll go back and rewrite this so it’s more like the sine curve that we use to sense brightness.\nI’m still working on the MQTT/HomeAssistant connection for this lamp – it’s kind of a shame to use the blazing fast ESP32 at about 1% of its capacity, and just wasting the wifi/bluetooth connections! I’ll update here when I’ve successfully incorporated different patterns that can be controlled within an HA dashboard."

Here we show that Mtb invasion relies on an intact sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition or knockout of early sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes greatly reduces Mtb uptake across multiple phagocytic cell types without affecting other forms of endocytosis. While the phagocytic receptor Dectin-1 undergoes normal clustering at the pathogen contact sites, sphingolipid biosynthetic mutant cells fail to segregate the regulatory phosphatase CD45 from the clustered receptors. Blocking sphingolipid production also impairs downstream activation of Rho GTPases, actin dynamics, and phosphoinositide turnover at the nascent phagocytic cup. Moreover, we find that production of sphingomyelin, not glycosphingolipids, is essential for Mtb uptake. Collectively, our data support a critical role of sphingomyelin biosynthesis in an early stage of Mtb infection and provide novel insights into the mechanism underlying phagocytic entry of this pathogen.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 4\n\n\nSealing the Gaps: Sphingolipids are essential for repairing the endosomal damage caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\n\nTuberculosis infection remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, causing over 1.3 million deaths in 2022 alone. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), there is a pressing need for novel and improved therapeutics. Here, we characterize the critical role of sphingolipids in restricting intracellular replication of Mtb. Sphingolipids are essential for rapidly responding to membrane damage and maintaining lysosomal integrity during Mtb infection. Additionally, sphingolipids enable the restriction of Mtb growth within host cells. Understanding the influence of host sphingolipids on Mtb infection may reveal novel routes for host-directed therapy. This research provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of Mtb infection and could pave the way for developing new therapeutic strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 5\n\n\nLiving Off the Fat of the Cell: A lipidomics map of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected cell\n\n\nFor centuries, humans have been seeking reliable treatment for tuberculosis, but unfortunately, it still poses a significant threat to global health. Recent research has shown that host lipid biology may offer new opportunities for developing novel antitubercular therapy. Here, we identify unique signatures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection by comparing the global lipidome of cells infected with pathogenic and attenuated Mtb strains against the lipidomes of cells treated with isolated Mtb cell wall components. We find that pathogenic and attenuated infections and treatments with pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce significant upregulation of diacylglycerol production. However, only pathogenic infection increases the production of triacylglycerol and acylcarnitine, reflecting induced fatty acid β-oxidation, while inhibiting the synthesis of lysophospholipids and plasmalogens, which reflects concerted subversions of the macrophage antimicrobial program. This research shows great potential in identifying potential host-directed therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 6\n\n\nAn Affinity for Sphingolipids: Trifunctional lipid probes reveal protein-sphingolipid interactions during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection\n\n\nUnderstanding the molecular interactions underlying Mtb’s capacity for immune subversion and hijacking of the host cell can provide a unique insight into potential new routes of antitubercular therapy. Because Mtb is a pathogen with a unique sensitivity to the host lipid compartment, and because sphingolipids are a lipid family with emerging roles in regulating antimicrobial functions in macrophages, we sought to characterize the sphingolipid interactome of an Mtb-infected cell. To this end, we utilized trifunctionalized lipid analogs as affinity handles for enrichment proteomics. We found that Mtb infection induces a significant reprogramming of proteins that interact with sphingosine. These changes included a downregulation of interactions among proteins involved in secretory trafficking and lysosomal maturation and an upregulation of interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. We further identify a candidate Mtb protein that selectively interacts with trifunctional sphingosine. This analysis is the first of its kind and represents a crucial step in characterizing how sphingolipids mediate the cellular response to intracellular infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 7\n\n\nGenetic tools to study sphingolipids in disease\n\n\nSphingolipids are a critical family of membrane lipids with diverse functions in eukaryotic cells, and a growing body of literature supports that these lipids play essential roles during the lifecycles of viruses. While small molecule inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis and metabolism are widely used, the advent of CRISPR-based genomic editing techniques allows for nuanced exploration into the manners in which sphingolipids influence various stages of viral infections. Here we describe some of these critical considerations needed in designing studies utilizing genomic editing techniques for manipulating the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, as well as the current body of literature regarding how viruses depend on the products of this pathway. Here, we highlight the ways in which sphingolipids affect viruses as these pathogens interact with and influence their host cell and describe some of the many open questions remaining in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 8\n\n\nThe Squeaky Yeast Gets Greased: The Roles of Host Lipids in the Clearance of Pathogenic Fungi\n\n\nFungal infections remain a global health threat with high morbidity and mortality. The human immune system must, therefore, perpetually defend against invasive fungal infections. Phagocytosis is critical for the clearance of fungal pathogens, as this cellular process allows select immune cells to internalize and destroy invading fungal cells. While much is known about the protein players that enable phagocytosis, the various roles that lipids play during this fundamental innate immune process are still being illuminated. In this review, we describe recent discoveries that shed new light on the mechanisms by which host lipids enable the phagocytic uptake and clearance of fungal pathogens.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 9\n\n\nRapid visualization and quantification of phagocytosis in neutrophils\n\n\nPhagocytosis by phagocytes such as neutrophils is a crucial part of the host innate immune response against invading pathogens. Phagocytosis is a complex process that initiates with the binding of the particles on the cell surface of the phagocytes through the interaction of pattern recognition receptors with ligands on the surface of the pathogens. During this process, phagocytes undergo extensive membrane reorganization and cytoskeleton rearrangement at their cell surface. To gain better insight about the molecular mechanisms of this dynamic cellular process, visualization and quantification in a high-throughput manner is essential. Here, we describe a microscope-based method to visualize and quantify phagocytic uptake of pathogens (such as bacteria and fungi) and model particulates that are larger than 0.5 μm (such as Zymosan A and IgG-coated beads).\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 10\n\n\nSystematic analysis of the sphingomyelin synthase family in C. elegans\n\n\nSphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of mammalian cell membranes and particularly abundant in the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. Its production is catalyzed by SM synthases SMS1 and SMS2, which interconvert phosphatidylcholine and ceramide to diacylglycerol and SM in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane, respectively. As the lipids participating in this reaction fulfill both structural and signaling functions, SMS enzymes have considerable potential to influence diverse important cellular processes. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model for studying both animal development and human disease. The organism contains five SMS homologues but none of these have been characterized in any detail. Here, we carried out the first systematic analysis of SMS family members in C. elegans. Using heterologous expression systems, genetic ablation, metabolic labeling and lipidome analyses, we show that C. elegans harbors at least three distinct SM synthases and one ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) synthase. Moreover, C. elegans SMS family members have partially overlapping but also unique sub-cellular distributions and together occupy all principal compartments of the secretory pathway. Our findings shed light on crucial aspects of sphingolipid metabolism in a valuable animal model and opens avenues for exploring the role of SM and its metabolic intermediates in organismal development.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lipid Interactome\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive web tool aggregates the data from a number of publications which utilize synthetic, functionalized lipid analogs to do affinity enrichment in order to identify the protein interactors of select bioactive lipids.\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 25, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

This intracellular pathogen uses many mechanisms to subvert the host immune system and lie undetected before causing active disease. This subtle pathogen is uniquely dependent on host lipids for energy, production of host-damaging materiel, and immune subversion. In the face of antibiotic-resistant Mtb strains, researchers have turned toward lipid biology for potential avenues of novel antitubercular therapy. The sphingolipid family has gained attention for its profound roles in determining cell fate, immune signaling, and antimicrobial activity. We review the state of the field regarding sphingolipids as candidate targets of host-directed antitubercular intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 3\n\n\nBreaking and Entering: Sphingomyelin Biosynthesis Is Essential for Phagocytic Signaling during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Host Cell Entry\n\n\nPhagocytosis by alveolar macrophages is the obligate first step in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, yet the mechanism underlying this process is incompletely understood.

Recent research has shown that host lipid biology may offer new opportunities for developing novel antitubercular therapy. Here, we identify unique signatures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection by comparing the global lipidome of cells infected with pathogenic and attenuated Mtb strains against the lipidomes of cells treated with isolated Mtb cell wall components. We find that pathogenic and attenuated infections and treatments with pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce significant upregulation of diacylglycerol production. However, only pathogenic infection increases the production of triacylglycerol and acylcarnitine, reflecting induced fatty acid β-oxidation, while inhibiting the synthesis of lysophospholipids and plasmalogens, which reflects concerted subversions of the macrophage antimicrobial program.

Because Mtb is a pathogen with a unique sensitivity to the host lipid compartment, and because sphingolipids are a lipid family with emerging roles in regulating antimicrobial functions in macrophages, we sought to characterize the sphingolipid interactome of an Mtb-infected cell. To this end, we utilized trifunctionalized lipid analogs as affinity handles for enrichment proteomics. We found that Mtb infection induces a significant reprogramming of proteins that interact with sphingosine. These changes included a downregulation of interactions among proteins involved in secretory trafficking and lysosomal maturation and an upregulation of interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. We further identify a candidate Mtb protein that selectively interacts with trifunctional sphingosine.

The human immune system must, therefore, perpetually defend against invasive fungal infections. Phagocytosis is critical for the clearance of fungal pathogens, as this cellular process allows select immune cells to internalize and destroy invading fungal cells.

Phagocytosis is a complex process that initiates with the binding of the particles on the cell surface of the phagocytes through the interaction of pattern recognition receptors with ligands on the surface of the pathogens. During this process, phagocytes undergo extensive membrane reorganization and cytoskeleton rearrangement at their cell surface. To gain better insight about the molecular mechanisms of this dynamic cellular process, visualization and quantification in a high-throughput manner is essential. Here, we describe a microscope-based method to visualize and quantify phagocytic uptake of pathogens (such as bacteria and fungi) and model particulates that are larger than 0.5 μm (such as Zymosan A and IgG-coated beads).\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Chapter 10\n\n\nSystematic analysis of the sphingomyelin synthase family in C. elegans\n\n\nSphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of mammalian cell membranes and particularly abundant in the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers.

We review the state of the field regarding sphingolipids as candidate targets of host-directed antitubercular intervention.\n\n\n\nBreaking and Entering: Sphingomyelin Biosynthesis Is Essential for Phagocytic Signaling during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Host Cell Entry\nAbstract:\n\nPhagocytosis by alveolar macrophages is the obligate first step in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, yet the mechanism underlying this process is incompletely understood. Here we show that Mtb invasion relies on an intact sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition or knockout of early sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes greatly reduces Mtb uptake across multiple phagocytic cell types without affecting other forms of endocytosis. While the phagocytic receptor Dectin-1 undergoes normal clustering at the pathogen contact sites, sphingolipid biosynthetic mutant cells fail to segregate the regulatory phosphatase CD45 from the clustered receptors. Blocking sphingolipid production also impairs downstream activation of Rho GTPases, actin dynamics, and phosphoinositide turnover at the nascent phagocytic cup. Moreover, we find that production of sphingomyelin, not glycosphingolipids, is essential for Mtb uptake. Collectively, our data support a critical role of sphingomyelin biosynthesis in an early stage of Mtb infection and provide novel insights into the mechanism underlying phagocytic entry of this pathogen.\n\n\n\nSealing the Gaps: Sphingolipids are essential for repairing the endosomal damage caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis\nAbstract:\n\nTuberculosis infection remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, causing over 1.3 million deaths in 2022 alone. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), there is a pressing need for novel and improved therapeutics. Here, we characterize the critical role of sphingolipids in restricting intracellular replication of Mtb. Sphingolipids are essential for rapidly responding to membrane damage and maintaining lysosomal integrity during Mtb infection. Additionally, sphingolipids enable the restriction of Mtb growth within host cells. Understanding the influence of host sphingolipids on Mtb infection may reveal novel routes for host-directed therapy. This research provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of Mtb infection and could pave the way for developing new therapeutic strategies.\n\n\n\nLiving Off the Fat of the Cell: A lipidomics map of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected cell\nAbstract:\n\nFor centuries, humans have been seeking reliable treatment for tuberculosis, but unfortunately, it still poses a significant threat to global health. Recent research has shown that host lipid biology may offer new opportunities for developing novel antitubercular therapy. Here, we identify unique signatures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection by comparing the global lipidome of cells infected with pathogenic and attenuated Mtb strains against the lipidomes of cells treated with isolated Mtb cell wall components. We find that pathogenic and attenuated infections and treatments with pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce significant upregulation of diacylglycerol production. However, only pathogenic infection increases the production of triacylglycerol and acylcarnitine, reflecting induced fatty acid β-oxidation, while inhibiting the synthesis of lysophospholipids and plasmalogens, which reflects concerted subversions of the macrophage antimicrobial program. This research shows great potential in identifying potential host-directed therapies.\n\n\n\nAn Affinity for Sphingolipids: Trifunctional lipid probes reveal protein-sphingolipid interactions during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection\nAbstract:\n\nUnderstanding the molecular interactions underlying Mtb’s capacity for immune subversion and hijacking of the host cell can provide a unique insight into potential new routes of antitubercular therapy. Because Mtb is a pathogen with a unique sensitivity to the host lipid compartment, and because sphingolipids are a lipid family with emerging roles in regulating antimicrobial functions in macrophages, we sought to characterize the sphingolipid interactome of an Mtb-infected cell. To this end, we utilized trifunctionalized lipid analogs as affinity handles for enrichment proteomics. We found that Mtb infection induces a significant reprogramming of proteins that interact with sphingosine. These changes included a downregulation of interactions among proteins involved in secretory trafficking and lysosomal maturation and an upregulation of interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. We further identify a candidate Mtb protein that selectively interacts with trifunctional sphingosine. This analysis is the first of its kind and represents a crucial step in characterizing how sphingolipids mediate the cellular response to intracellular infection.\n\n\n\nGenetic tools to study sphingolipids in disease\nAbstract:\n\nSphingolipids are a critical family of membrane lipids with diverse functions in eukaryotic cells, and a growing body of literature supports that these lipids play essential roles during the lifecycles of viruses. While small molecule inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis and metabolism are widely used, the advent of CRISPR-based genomic editing techniques allows for nuanced exploration into the manners in which sphingolipids influence various stages of viral infections. Here we describe some of these critical considerations needed in designing studies utilizing genomic editing techniques for manipulating the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, as well as the current body of literature regarding how viruses depend on the products of this pathway. Here, we highlight the ways in which sphingolipids affect viruses as these pathogens interact with and influence their host cell and describe some of the many open questions remaining in the field.\n\n\n\nThe Squeaky Yeast Gets Greased: The Roles of Host Lipids in the Clearance of Pathogenic Fungi\nAbstract:\n\nFungal infections remain a global health threat with high morbidity and mortality. The human immune system must, therefore, perpetually defend against invasive fungal infections. Phagocytosis is critical for the clearance of fungal pathogens, as this cellular process allows select immune cells to internalize and destroy invading fungal cells. While much is known about the protein players that enable phagocytosis, the various roles that lipids play during this fundamental innate immune process are still being illuminated. In this review, we describe recent discoveries that shed new light on the mechanisms by which host lipids enable the phagocytic uptake and clearance of fungal pathogens.\n\n\n\nRapid visualization and quantification of phagocytosis in neutrophils\nAbstract:\n\nPhagocytosis by phagocytes such as neutrophils is a crucial part of the host innate immune response against invading pathogens. Phagocytosis is a complex process that initiates with the binding of the particles on the cell surface of the phagocytes through the interaction of pattern recognition receptors with ligands on the surface of the pathogens. During this process, phagocytes undergo extensive membrane reorganization and cytoskeleton rearrangement at their cell surface. To gain better insight about the molecular mechanisms of this dynamic cellular process, visualization and quantification in a high-throughput manner is essential. Here, we describe a microscope-based method to visualize and quantify phagocytic uptake of pathogens (such as bacteria and fungi) and model particulates that are larger than 0.5 μm (such as Zymosan A and IgG-coated beads).\n\n\n\nSystematic analysis of the sphingomyelin synthase family in C. elegans\nAbstract:\n\nSphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of mammalian cell membranes and particularly abundant in the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. Its production is catalyzed by SM synthases SMS1 and SMS2, which interconvert phosphatidylcholine and ceramide to diacylglycerol and SM in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane, respectively. As the lipids participating in this reaction fulfill both structural and signaling functions, SMS enzymes have considerable potential to influence diverse important cellular processes. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model for studying both animal development and human disease. The organism contains five SMS homologues but none of these have been characterized in any detail. Here, we carried out the first systematic analysis of SMS family members in C. elegans. Using heterologous expression systems, genetic ablation, metabolic labeling and lipidome analyses, we show that C. elegans harbors at least three distinct SM synthases and one ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) synthase. Moreover, C. elegans SMS family members have partially overlapping but also unique sub-cellular distributions and together occupy all principal compartments of the secretory pathway. Our findings shed light on crucial aspects of sphingolipid metabolism in a valuable animal model and opens avenues for exploring the role of SM and its metabolic intermediates in organismal development."
