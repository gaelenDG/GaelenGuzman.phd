Now that I write it down, it’s likely to drastically change, as he likes to keep everyone on their toes.\nThe wake windows are highlighted in bold, and the total amount of time he’s awake is usually pretty consistent.\n\n6:30 am – Quick morning snack before returning to slumber\n9:00 am – Up for real this time! He’ll only be up for 2 hrs, precisely! Likes morning playtime and a real food meal (oatmeal, yogurt, berries)\n11:00 am – First “real” nap. Usually pretty close to 90 mins, though frequently anywhere between 45 - 120 mins.\n12:30 pm – Second wake window! He’ll be awake for 2.5 - 3 hrs. I like to try to get out of the house for this one – maybe a park or a longer walk. Make sure to bring some food, he really doesn’t drink formula out and about anymore.\n3:30 pm – Second nap. Length usually depends on how long the first one was – they typically add up to about 3 hrs total (i.e. if the first was 90 mins, the second will also be 90 mins)\n5:00 pm – Last wake window! He’ll be up til bedtime. We like to give him some backyard/pool time and a big dinner: this is where he’s most interested in savory foods – he’ll happily eat whatever you’re eating, lol. Consider bath time near the end of this window if he’s gotten a lot of food all over.\n7:45 pm – Bedtime routine! See below.\n8:00 pm – Bedtime. He’s almost always completely tuckered out and ready for bed precisely at 8."

I like to do all this with the lights off and either quietly chatting with him or singing:\n\nFresh diaper (stored in the funny tv stand in the basement, changing pad on the floor)\nGet into sleep sack (usually hanging in the opening to the pack ’n play)\nBottle of formula (he rarely drinks it all, but I usually like to bring 6 oz down with me)\nUsually he’ll either signal that he’s done drinking (shaking his head, waving the bottle away) or start to get too sleepy to continue eating (I usually save whatever’s left in the bottle for 15-20 mins, just in case he has trouble falling asleep)\nPlop him into the pack ’n play and zip the tent shut\nMake sure the white noise machine is on (it usually is, but you just have to tap the metal ring on the top of the Hatch to start it)\n\nWhen to intervene: Sometimes this guy is just too wound up or too tired to fall asleep, and he’ll complain/yell for a few minutes. If he’s really upset (actually screaming) or if it’s been more than ~15 minutes, I’d go down there to check on him – sometimes he’ll realize he’s still hungry once he’s in his tent, other times he has a big burp, and other other times he’ll need a new diaper before going to sleep. I usually bring ~2 oz of formula down with me and check if he’s interested.\nBig heads up: The sound has been unpredictable on the baby monitor for a few weeks now – you may need to actively check every once in a while by looking at the screen or listening for him from the door upstairs. We’re trying to figure out what’s wrong with it, so hopefully you won’t have to deal with this.\nBaby monitor update: The microphone is now totally dead in the baby monitor… So I made one! There are a few ways to access the audio stream:\n\nAs long as you’re on our WiFi, you can go to this link on any device: http://192.168.0.42:8000/babyroom.mp3. I recommend checking that the stream is still playing every once in a while – my phone likes to shut it off frequently…\nYou can also use the Home Assistant app on the really shitty purple tablet – when you open the app it should be the first view available, just press play and make sure the volume is up.\n\nThis thing is a piece of trash lol, so if it isn’t working you can try to restart the HA app.\nIf it’s still still not working, try opening the Tailscale app and see if it says “Connected” at the top (If the battery died, you’ll need to do this also!).\nSometimes this thing just doesn’t work and it defies all logic, just give up and use the link above on a different device.\n\nYou can hear him from pretty much anywhere in the house once he starts yelling, don’t panic if the tablet isn’t working and link above is broken, you’ll definitely hear him if you’re inside!"

There will probably be a bunch of clean bottles in or near the drying rack – feel free to leave used bottles to soak in soapy water for us to wash them in a big batch!\n\n\nSolid Foods\nThis guy likes to eat. Our main resource for serving safe solid foods is the Solid Starts app. It has a lot of great information about what foods are safe for babies, how to prepare them, and how to serve them.\nThere are only a few no-gos right now, and they include:\n\nHoney\nCured/deli meats\nCrunchy/hard things\nAdded sugar\nTrachea shaped (un-squished berries, whole grapes, whole cherry tomatoes, etc.)\n\nWe prefer that he either eats solid foods while sitting in his high chair or sitting fully upright – laying back in his car seat is not ideal due to choking risk.\nWe will have (ideally) prepped a little container of easy snack foods in the fridge.

Fill the sink with a few inches of comfortably warm water. WARNING: THE WATER CAN GET VERY VERY HOT. He’s extremely interested in playing with the sink handle, so we like to give him some bath toys to keep his hands occupied.\nPool: In most ways this is easier than the sink because somehow he doesn’t mind cold water? Just make sure it’s not like really really cold and that he doesn’t eat any sticks/leaves/bugs that fell in."

A historical overview of tuberculosis and sphingolipids\n\n\nAn accessible introduction to my dissertation.\n\n\nThis chapter explores the devastating illness of tuberculosis (TB) and the growing interest in host-directed therapy (HDT) as a potential avenue for novel anti-TB therapies. We aim to convey how one niche class of human lipids, sphingolipids, may affect the course of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. We introduce TB, its historical context, and the evolution of mycobacteria alongside humans. We also introduce the crucial and enigmatic roles of sphingolipids throughout human biology and how they may present novel ways of treating TB infections. These historical contexts are essential for a deeper discussion on the interplay between Mtb infection and the lipids in the host cell. Further, it is necessary for individuals attempting to discover potential tuberculosis treatments to consider the disease’s historical background. A low-cost, effective therapy is a crucial first step in rectifying the long-standing systemic injustices of tuberculosis treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. TB & The Sphinx\n\n\nA technical review of sphingolipids as a target of host directed therapies for treating Tuberculosis disease.\n\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a significant cause of infectious death worldwide. This intracellular pathogen uses many mechanisms to subvert the host immune system and lie undetected before causing active disease. This subtle pathogen is uniquely dependent on host lipids for energy, production of host-damaging materiel, and immune subversion. In the face of antibiotic-resistant Mtb strains, researchers have turned toward lipid biology for potential avenues of novel antitubercular therapy. The sphingolipid family has gained attention for its profound roles in determining cell fate, immune signaling, and antimicrobial activity. We review the state of the field regarding sphingolipids as candidate targets of host-directed antitubercular intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Breaking and Entering\n\n\nSphingomyelin Biosynthesis Is Essential for Phagocytic Signaling during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Host Cell Entry\n\n\nPhagocytosis by alveolar macrophages is the obligate first step in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, yet the mechanism underlying this process is incompletely understood. Here we show that Mtb invasion relies on an intact sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition or knockout of early sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes greatly reduces Mtb uptake across multiple phagocytic cell types without affecting other forms of endocytosis.

Recent research has shown that host lipid biology may offer new opportunities for developing novel antitubercular therapy. Here, we identify unique signatures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection by comparing the global lipidome of cells infected with pathogenic and attenuated Mtb strains against the lipidomes of cells treated with isolated Mtb cell wall components. We find that pathogenic and attenuated infections and treatments with pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce significant upregulation of diacylglycerol production. However, only pathogenic infection increases the production of triacylglycerol and acylcarnitine, reflecting induced fatty acid β-oxidation, while inhibiting the synthesis of lysophospholipids and plasmalogens, which reflects concerted subversions of the macrophage antimicrobial program. This research shows great potential in identifying potential host-directed therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.

Because Mtb is a pathogen with a unique sensitivity to the host lipid compartment, and because sphingolipids are a lipid family with emerging roles in regulating antimicrobial functions in macrophages, we sought to characterize the sphingolipid interactome of an Mtb-infected cell. To this end, we utilized trifunctionalized lipid analogs as affinity handles for enrichment proteomics. We found that Mtb infection induces a significant reprogramming of proteins that interact with sphingosine. These changes included a downregulation of interactions among proteins involved in secretory trafficking and lysosomal maturation and an upregulation of interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. We further identify a candidate Mtb protein that selectively interacts with trifunctional sphingosine. This analysis is the first of its kind and represents a crucial step in characterizing how sphingolipids mediate the cellular response to intracellular infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.

During this process, phagocytes undergo extensive membrane reorganization and cytoskeleton rearrangement at their cell surface. To gain better insight about the molecular mechanisms of this dynamic cellular process, visualization and quantification in a high-throughput manner is essential.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model for studying both animal development and human disease. The organism contains five SMS homologues but none of these have been characterized in any detail. Here, we carried out the first systematic analysis of SMS family members in C. elegans. Using heterologous expression systems, genetic ablation, metabolic labeling and lipidome analyses, we show that C. elegans harbors at least three distinct SM synthases and one ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) synthase. Moreover, C. elegans SMS family members have partially overlapping but also unique sub-cellular distributions and together occupy all principal compartments of the secretory pathway.

This intracellular pathogen uses many mechanisms to subvert the host immune system and lie undetected before causing active disease. This subtle pathogen is uniquely dependent on host lipids for energy, production of host-damaging materiel, and immune subversion. In the face of antibiotic-resistant Mtb strains, researchers have turned toward lipid biology for potential avenues of novel antitubercular therapy. The sphingolipid family has gained attention for its profound roles in determining cell fate, immune signaling, and antimicrobial activity.

TB & The Sphinx\n\n\nA technical review of sphingolipids as a target of host directed therapies for treating Tuberculosis disease.\n\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a significant cause of infectious death worldwide. This intracellular pathogen uses many mechanisms to subvert the host immune system and lie undetected before causing active disease. This subtle pathogen is uniquely dependent on host lipids for energy, production of host-damaging materiel, and immune subversion. In the face of antibiotic-resistant Mtb strains, researchers have turned toward lipid biology for potential avenues of novel antitubercular therapy. The sphingolipid family has gained attention for its profound roles in determining cell fate, immune signaling, and antimicrobial activity. We review the state of the field regarding sphingolipids as candidate targets of host-directed antitubercular intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Breaking and Entering\n\n\nSphingomyelin Biosynthesis Is Essential for Phagocytic Signaling during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Host Cell Entry\n\n\nPhagocytosis by alveolar macrophages is the obligate first step in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, yet the mechanism underlying this process is incompletely understood. Here we show that Mtb invasion relies on an intact sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition or knockout of early sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes greatly reduces Mtb uptake across multiple phagocytic cell types without affecting other forms of endocytosis. While the phagocytic receptor Dectin-1 undergoes normal clustering at the pathogen contact sites, sphingolipid biosynthetic mutant cells fail to segregate the regulatory phosphatase CD45 from the clustered receptors. Blocking sphingolipid production also impairs downstream activation of Rho GTPases, actin dynamics, and phosphoinositide turnover at the nascent phagocytic cup. Moreover, we find that production of sphingomyelin, not glycosphingolipids, is essential for Mtb uptake. Collectively, our data support a critical role of sphingomyelin biosynthesis in an early stage of Mtb infection and provide novel insights into the mechanism underlying phagocytic entry of this pathogen.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Sealing the Gaps\n\n\nSphingolipids are essential for repairing the endosomal damage caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\n\nTuberculosis infection remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, causing over 1.3 million deaths in 2022 alone. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), there is a pressing need for novel and improved therapeutics. Here, we characterize the critical role of sphingolipids in restricting intracellular replication of Mtb. Sphingolipids are essential for rapidly responding to membrane damage and maintaining lysosomal integrity during Mtb infection. Additionally, sphingolipids enable the restriction of Mtb growth within host cells. Understanding the influence of host sphingolipids on Mtb infection may reveal novel routes for host-directed therapy. This research provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of Mtb infection and could pave the way for developing new therapeutic strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Living Off the Fat of the Cell\n\n\nA lipidomics map of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected cell\n\n\nFor centuries, humans have been seeking reliable treatment for tuberculosis, but unfortunately, it still poses a significant threat to global health. Recent research has shown that host lipid biology may offer new opportunities for developing novel antitubercular therapy. Here, we identify unique signatures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection by comparing the global lipidome of cells infected with pathogenic and attenuated Mtb strains against the lipidomes of cells treated with isolated Mtb cell wall components. We find that pathogenic and attenuated infections and treatments with pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce significant upregulation of diacylglycerol production. However, only pathogenic infection increases the production of triacylglycerol and acylcarnitine, reflecting induced fatty acid β-oxidation, while inhibiting the synthesis of lysophospholipids and plasmalogens, which reflects concerted subversions of the macrophage antimicrobial program. This research shows great potential in identifying potential host-directed therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. An Affinity for Sphingolipids\n\n\nTrifunctional lipid probes reveal protein-sphingolipid interactions during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection\n\n\nUnderstanding the molecular interactions underlying Mtb’s capacity for immune subversion and hijacking of the host cell can provide a unique insight into potential new routes of antitubercular therapy. Because Mtb is a pathogen with a unique sensitivity to the host lipid compartment, and because sphingolipids are a lipid family with emerging roles in regulating antimicrobial functions in macrophages, we sought to characterize the sphingolipid interactome of an Mtb-infected cell. To this end, we utilized trifunctionalized lipid analogs as affinity handles for enrichment proteomics. We found that Mtb infection induces a significant reprogramming of proteins that interact with sphingosine. These changes included a downregulation of interactions among proteins involved in secretory trafficking and lysosomal maturation and an upregulation of interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. We further identify a candidate Mtb protein that selectively interacts with trifunctional sphingosine. This analysis is the first of its kind and represents a crucial step in characterizing how sphingolipids mediate the cellular response to intracellular infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Genetic tools to study sphingolipids in disease\n\n\nA review of available methodologies to study the roles of sphingolipids in viral infections.\n\n\nSphingolipids are a critical family of membrane lipids with diverse functions in eukaryotic cells, and a growing body of literature supports that these lipids play essential roles during the lifecycles of viruses. While small molecule inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis and metabolism are widely used, the advent of CRISPR-based genomic editing techniques allows for nuanced exploration into the manners in which sphingolipids influence various stages of viral infections. Here we describe some of these critical considerations needed in designing studies utilizing genomic editing techniques for manipulating the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, as well as the current body of literature regarding how viruses depend on the products of this pathway. Here, we highlight the ways in which sphingolipids affect viruses as these pathogens interact with and influence their host cell and describe some of the many open questions remaining in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. The Squeaky Yeast Gets Greased\n\n\nThe Roles of Host Lipids in the Clearance of Pathogenic Fungi\n\n\nFungal infections remain a global health threat with high morbidity and mortality. The human immune system must, therefore, perpetually defend against invasive fungal infections. Phagocytosis is critical for the clearance of fungal pathogens, as this cellular process allows select immune cells to internalize and destroy invading fungal cells. While much is known about the protein players that enable phagocytosis, the various roles that lipids play during this fundamental innate immune process are still being illuminated. In this review, we describe recent discoveries that shed new light on the mechanisms by which host lipids enable the phagocytic uptake and clearance of fungal pathogens.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Rapid visualization and quantification of phagocytosis in neutrophils\n\n\nA protocol for using high-content fluorescence microscopy to quantify phagocytosis.\n\n\nPhagocytosis by phagocytes such as neutrophils is a crucial part of the host innate immune response against invading pathogens. Phagocytosis is a complex process that initiates with the binding of the particles on the cell surface of the phagocytes through the interaction of pattern recognition receptors with ligands on the surface of the pathogens. During this process, phagocytes undergo extensive membrane reorganization and cytoskeleton rearrangement at their cell surface. To gain better insight about the molecular mechanisms of this dynamic cellular process, visualization and quantification in a high-throughput manner is essential. Here, we describe a microscope-based method to visualize and quantify phagocytic uptake of pathogens (such as bacteria and fungi) and model particulates that are larger than 0.5 μm (such as Zymosan A and IgG-coated beads).\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Systematic analysis of the sphingomyelin synthase family in C. elegans\n\n\nThe identification and characterization of a family of sphingomyelin synthases in C. elegans nematodes.\n\n\nSphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of mammalian cell membranes and particularly abundant in the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. Its production is catalyzed by SM synthases SMS1 and SMS2, which interconvert phosphatidylcholine and ceramide to diacylglycerol and SM in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane, respectively. As the lipids participating in this reaction fulfill both structural and signaling functions, SMS enzymes have considerable potential to influence diverse important cellular processes. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model for studying both animal development and human disease. The organism contains five SMS homologues but none of these have been characterized in any detail. Here, we carried out the first systematic analysis of SMS family members in C. elegans. Using heterologous expression systems, genetic ablation, metabolic labeling and lipidome analyses, we show that C. elegans harbors at least three distinct SM synthases and one ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) synthase. Moreover, C. elegans SMS family members have partially overlapping but also unique sub-cellular distributions and together occupy all principal compartments of the secretory pathway. Our findings shed light on crucial aspects of sphingolipid metabolism in a valuable animal model and opens avenues for exploring the role of SM and its metabolic intermediates in organismal development.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n  \n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

Systematic analysis of the sphingomyelin synthase family in C. elegans\n\n\nThe identification and characterization of a family of sphingomyelin synthases in C. elegans nematodes.\n\n\nSphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of mammalian cell membranes and particularly abundant in the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. Its production is catalyzed by SM synthases SMS1 and SMS2, which interconvert phosphatidylcholine and ceramide to diacylglycerol and SM in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane, respectively. As the lipids participating in this reaction fulfill both structural and signaling functions, SMS enzymes have considerable potential to influence diverse important cellular processes. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model for studying both animal development and human disease. The organism contains five SMS homologues but none of these have been characterized in any detail. Here, we carried out the first systematic analysis of SMS family members in C. elegans. Using heterologous expression systems, genetic ablation, metabolic labeling and lipidome analyses, we show that C. elegans harbors at least three distinct SM synthases and one ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) synthase. Moreover, C. elegans SMS family members have partially overlapping but also unique sub-cellular distributions and together occupy all principal compartments of the secretory pathway. Our findings shed light on crucial aspects of sphingolipid metabolism in a valuable animal model and opens avenues for exploring the role of SM and its metabolic intermediates in organismal development.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. TB & The Sphinx\n\n\nA technical review of sphingolipids as a target of host directed therapies for treating Tuberculosis disease.\n\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a significant cause of infectious death worldwide. This intracellular pathogen uses many mechanisms to subvert the host immune system and lie undetected before causing active disease. This subtle pathogen is uniquely dependent on host lipids for energy, production of host-damaging materiel, and immune subversion. In the face of antibiotic-resistant Mtb strains, researchers have turned toward lipid biology for potential avenues of novel antitubercular therapy. The sphingolipid family has gained attention for its profound roles in determining cell fate, immune signaling, and antimicrobial activity. We review the state of the field regarding sphingolipids as candidate targets of host-directed antitubercular intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Breaking and Entering\n\n\nSphingomyelin Biosynthesis Is Essential for Phagocytic Signaling during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Host Cell Entry\n\n\nPhagocytosis by alveolar macrophages is the obligate first step in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, yet the mechanism underlying this process is incompletely understood. Here we show that Mtb invasion relies on an intact sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition or knockout of early sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes greatly reduces Mtb uptake across multiple phagocytic cell types without affecting other forms of endocytosis. While the phagocytic receptor Dectin-1 undergoes normal clustering at the pathogen contact sites, sphingolipid biosynthetic mutant cells fail to segregate the regulatory phosphatase CD45 from the clustered receptors. Blocking sphingolipid production also impairs downstream activation of Rho GTPases, actin dynamics, and phosphoinositide turnover at the nascent phagocytic cup. Moreover, we find that production of sphingomyelin, not glycosphingolipids, is essential for Mtb uptake. Collectively, our data support a critical role of sphingomyelin biosynthesis in an early stage of Mtb infection and provide novel insights into the mechanism underlying phagocytic entry of this pathogen.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Sealing the Gaps\n\n\nSphingolipids are essential for repairing the endosomal damage caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\n\nTuberculosis infection remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, causing over 1.3 million deaths in 2022 alone. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), there is a pressing need for novel and improved therapeutics. Here, we characterize the critical role of sphingolipids in restricting intracellular replication of Mtb. Sphingolipids are essential for rapidly responding to membrane damage and maintaining lysosomal integrity during Mtb infection. Additionally, sphingolipids enable the restriction of Mtb growth within host cells. Understanding the influence of host sphingolipids on Mtb infection may reveal novel routes for host-directed therapy. This research provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of Mtb infection and could pave the way for developing new therapeutic strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Living Off the Fat of the Cell\n\n\nA lipidomics map of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected cell\n\n\nFor centuries, humans have been seeking reliable treatment for tuberculosis, but unfortunately, it still poses a significant threat to global health. Recent research has shown that host lipid biology may offer new opportunities for developing novel antitubercular therapy. Here, we identify unique signatures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection by comparing the global lipidome of cells infected with pathogenic and attenuated Mtb strains against the lipidomes of cells treated with isolated Mtb cell wall components. We find that pathogenic and attenuated infections and treatments with pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce significant upregulation of diacylglycerol production. However, only pathogenic infection increases the production of triacylglycerol and acylcarnitine, reflecting induced fatty acid β-oxidation, while inhibiting the synthesis of lysophospholipids and plasmalogens, which reflects concerted subversions of the macrophage antimicrobial program. This research shows great potential in identifying potential host-directed therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. An Affinity for Sphingolipids\n\n\nTrifunctional lipid probes reveal protein-sphingolipid interactions during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection\n\n\nUnderstanding the molecular interactions underlying Mtb’s capacity for immune subversion and hijacking of the host cell can provide a unique insight into potential new routes of antitubercular therapy. Because Mtb is a pathogen with a unique sensitivity to the host lipid compartment, and because sphingolipids are a lipid family with emerging roles in regulating antimicrobial functions in macrophages, we sought to characterize the sphingolipid interactome of an Mtb-infected cell. To this end, we utilized trifunctionalized lipid analogs as affinity handles for enrichment proteomics. We found that Mtb infection induces a significant reprogramming of proteins that interact with sphingosine. These changes included a downregulation of interactions among proteins involved in secretory trafficking and lysosomal maturation and an upregulation of interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. We further identify a candidate Mtb protein that selectively interacts with trifunctional sphingosine. This analysis is the first of its kind and represents a crucial step in characterizing how sphingolipids mediate the cellular response to intracellular infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Genetic tools to study sphingolipids in disease\n\n\nA review of available methodologies to study the roles of sphingolipids in viral infections.\n\n\nSphingolipids are a critical family of membrane lipids with diverse functions in eukaryotic cells, and a growing body of literature supports that these lipids play essential roles during the lifecycles of viruses. While small molecule inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis and metabolism are widely used, the advent of CRISPR-based genomic editing techniques allows for nuanced exploration into the manners in which sphingolipids influence various stages of viral infections. Here we describe some of these critical considerations needed in designing studies utilizing genomic editing techniques for manipulating the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, as well as the current body of literature regarding how viruses depend on the products of this pathway. Here, we highlight the ways in which sphingolipids affect viruses as these pathogens interact with and influence their host cell and describe some of the many open questions remaining in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. The Squeaky Yeast Gets Greased\n\n\nThe Roles of Host Lipids in the Clearance of Pathogenic Fungi\n\n\nFungal infections remain a global health threat with high morbidity and mortality. The human immune system must, therefore, perpetually defend against invasive fungal infections. Phagocytosis is critical for the clearance of fungal pathogens, as this cellular process allows select immune cells to internalize and destroy invading fungal cells. While much is known about the protein players that enable phagocytosis, the various roles that lipids play during this fundamental innate immune process are still being illuminated. In this review, we describe recent discoveries that shed new light on the mechanisms by which host lipids enable the phagocytic uptake and clearance of fungal pathogens.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Rapid visualization and quantification of phagocytosis in neutrophils\n\n\nA protocol for using high-content fluorescence microscopy to quantify phagocytosis.\n\n\nPhagocytosis by phagocytes such as neutrophils is a crucial part of the host innate immune response against invading pathogens. Phagocytosis is a complex process that initiates with the binding of the particles on the cell surface of the phagocytes through the interaction of pattern recognition receptors with ligands on the surface of the pathogens. During this process, phagocytes undergo extensive membrane reorganization and cytoskeleton rearrangement at their cell surface. To gain better insight about the molecular mechanisms of this dynamic cellular process, visualization and quantification in a high-throughput manner is essential. Here, we describe a microscope-based method to visualize and quantify phagocytic uptake of pathogens (such as bacteria and fungi) and model particulates that are larger than 0.5 μm (such as Zymosan A and IgG-coated beads).\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation\n\n\n\n\n\nMy dissertation is free to view online – all 300 pages of it!

This function takes arguments for position, red value, green value, blue value, and white value – and then determines which NeoPixel to apply the RGBW value to.\nAt heart, every pattern just applies this light function in different ways. The really tricky part was getting the loop to recognize when the button was pressed. I needed to learn about the Interupt Service Routine, and use it to respond to button presses. A second big challenge came with the discovery that the button I chose had terrible debounce behavior – as is probably obvious in the “final product” video above, the button only registers like 1/3 of the time…\nThere is a global counter that increases with each detected button press (mod arithmetic rolls it back over when the count is &gt;5). This counter feeds into a function that plays the appropriate pattern (setPattern()). Each pattern loops infinitely, but checks the value of the counter at the start of each loop – if the button count is different, the pattern breaks and setPattern() determines which pattern to display next.\nThis was the first project which I broke the config, helper functions, pattern functions, and main setup/loop into separate files – I’ve been struggling with the baby book project because the single-file organization is difficult to navigate!

    "text": "Assembly\n\n\n\n\nTesting the concept of the lamp, with really basic control via the ESP32.\n\n\n\n\nNext, I soldered the LEDs to power lines – I decided to directly integrate the current limiting resistor into the stalk of the mushroom so I wouldn’t be tempted to test the mushrooms without a resistor (a stupid mistake that killed my first test mushroom!).\nI then crafted the mushroom stalks using the silicone caulk: I squirted a line of some caulk out onto some plastic film, added a small amount of dye to make nice colors, and squashed the LEDs into the line. By folding the plastic wrap over and kneading carefully, I got the wires embedded in the center of the caulk and a mostly round cross-section.\n\n\n\n\nDrying the newly-formed caulk stalks! It took a few days for them to feel solid enough to peel the plastic wrap off.\n\n\n\n\nFor the mushroom caps, I squeezed out more caulk and dye to match the LED colors and left them to dry between layers of plastic wrap. I used the tops of bottles and curved things to help them set in the right shape. Once everything dried, I used a big glob of caulk to glue the tops to the bottoms.\nI then drilled 10 mm holes into my log in what I thought would appear to be a natural arrangement and fed the trailing LED leads through and then used more caulk to glue them in place. I also drilled and glued in place the light-dependent resistor near the back of the bark and the bare flickering LED right in the center. I left the underside of the amanita off for the time being – my vision was to make it big enough to cover the board underneath, so it needed to be glued in place as a final step.\nNext I started work on soldering the PCB. The main components here are the ESP32-C3 itself, one NPN2222a transistor for each LED (discussed a little more below), a pull-up resistor for the LDR, and trailing wires to power each LED pointing up away from the board so that they’d be long enough to solder to the trailing wires of the glued-in LEDs (This turned out to be a huge pain).\n\n\n\n\nForgive my terrible soldering, I was still learning and didn’t yet have a flux pen to help guide the solder in place! I also apparently never took a picture of the top…\n\n\n\nThe NPN2222a transistors were my rudimentary attempt at performing level shifting. The GPIO data out voltage is 3.3 V – and in my testing, it made the LEDs just not quite as bright as I wanted them, even after messing around with different resistor levels. I decided to bump them up to 5 V by connecting the Vcc lead to the emitter pin of the transistor, and the GPIO data line connected to the base. This allowed the ESP32 to regulate the apparent brightness of the LED via PWM and increased the maximum brightness with the higher Vcc. A few days after I soldered all my transistors in place, I learned about the 74AHCT125 Level Shifter, which performs the same action with four input/output pin pairs and only one Vcc in and ground connection each; I felt a little bit like a fool for having wasted so much space on a big bulky PCB that could have been so much smaller – but that’s learning!\nSoldering the LEDs to their lead wires was a huge pain. In retrospect, I should have set it up with two-pronged plugs to make them just slot into place. Instead, I had to painstakingly squeeze the hot soldering iron between the PCB and the bark, being careful to not melt anything. It was a many-hours-long struggle and resulted in a huge mess of connections which are super prone to shorting out with small jostles… This was definitely the worst way I could have done it! Big notes to my future self with this!\nAnd finally, I assembled a little log cabin using some sticks and more caulk. My vision didn’t really come to reality – this thing doesn’t look all that good and I still haven’t actually glued it in place because I keep telling myself I’ll make a new one… I should probably just glue it down and call it done though.\n\nNew board!\n\n\n\nKind of fun to see how much my circuit planning and soldering skills have improved! I whipped the new board together in a few hours and got it almost totally right in a single go – just had to clean up a poor joint of my ground bus once everything was hooked up.\n\n\nI glued the board in place, covered it with the bottom portion of the amanita – and just like that, the physical components of the lamp were done! I next got started making a real light pattern.\n\n\n\nThe final product!"

    "text": "Code\nUpdate: The below is outdated now, but is a fun look back at how I wrote my original script. The new controlling script is written in ESPhome via yaml, and performs all the same fundamental functions, except it’s no longer just a nightlight but is a dimmable light in HomeAssistant.\nThis was my first coding adventure with C++ – I’ll shamefully admit that I asked ChatGPT a lot of questions in order to get me started here, but after a while I started to realize it wasn’t that much more helpful than Googling my question and finding StackOverflow threads.\nPrior to this little project, I haven’t done basically anything with hardware, and it took a lot of learning to understand how to use non-blocking timing patterns to make sure that the lights don’t interfere with each other – and so that the lamp is constantly probing the surrounding light levels.\nIn short, the loop function starts by checking the ambient light – if it’s too light out, the lamp goes into a light sleep mode and checks again a few times each second. If the ambient light is dim enough, it triggers a step in the pattern light function.\nOn boot, each LED is assigned the minimum brightness value, an empty timer, and a random time interval. Using the random time interval, each LED is then assigned a calculated timespan for updating its brightness level. Each time the pattern loop begins, it goes through each LED and assesses whether an appropriate amount of time has passed to either increase or decrease the brightness ([total interval] / [num steps between min and max brightness]) – and if an appropriate amount of time has passed, the LED steps up until it hits the max brightness and then goes down until the minimum brightness. At the minimum brightness, the LED is assigned a new time interval.\nThe goal was to make the mushrooms look like they’re breathing, and I like to think it’s pretty good!\nThe LED inside the cabin flickers to make it seem like a little dweller is sitting by the fire. This isn’t directly controlled by the ESP32 – I just stole the LED from an electric candle, so it has a semi-random flickering pattern built into its PCB. The unfortunate side-effect of this is that I cannot control the brightness myself to adjust its pattern, but that’s ok."

    "text": "Future Improvements\n\nI truly did not plan for how difficult it would be to solder the lights to the board. In the future, I would vastly prefer to make the wires coming out of the LEDs much longer and tipped with 2-pin connectors so that they can just plug into the PCB! This would also help protect the lights from shorting to ground so easily…\n\n\nI got this done! It required ripping out the original board and making an entirely new one, but the final product is much more robust!\n\n\nThis is an easy fix I just haven’t done yet, but this nightlight has a silly flickering behavior when the ambient light is just barely dark enough to trigger the lamp because the lamp itself provides enough light to turn itself off! This would be fixed by just having two brightness thresholds, the “off” threshold being brightness than the “on” threshold – that way it turns on in relatively dim light and turns off only when it’s substantially brighter. I’ll go back and fix this sometime!\n\n\nAlso fixed, mostly by removing the nightlight behavior. I decided it would be fun to keep the LDR as a sensor entity in HomeAssistant, so I can “see” the day/night cycle of our living room – but it’s no longer toggling the lamp on and off.\n\n\nA slightly more complicated coding fix is to alter the brightness stepping function so that it better matches the perception of the human eye: right now it linearly adjusts the PWM value from min (25) to max (255) – but the eye perceives differences in brightness non-linearly. Someday I’ll go back and rewrite this so it’s more like the sine curve that we use to sense brightness.\n\n\nFixed this too!\n\n\nI’m still working on the MQTT/HomeAssistant connection for this lamp – it’s kind of a shame to use the blazing fast ESP32 at about 1% of its capacity, and just wasting the wifi/bluetooth connections! I’ll update here when I’ve successfully incorporated different patterns that can be controlled within an HA dashboard.\n\n\nDone! I decided that different patterns aren’t interesting to me because I really like the breathing effect. The lamp is now controlled purely in HomeAssistant."

    "text": "What the heck is this?\nThis page appears to be a departure from all the other little projects I have in this site, and on the off chance someone stumbles into this page, I thought I’d add some context. I plopped my little shiny app above so I could actually use it occasionally without scrolling through 1000 lines of text, like on every recipe site I’ve ever seen.\n\nStudying linear algebra for fun?\nTo the mild amusement of Madeleine, I’ve been working through the A First Course in Linear Algebra textbook by Robert Beezer (the online version can be found here). It sort of started because I was hoping to learn more about the principles underlying machine learning techniques like PCA and multiple linear regression – and then I discovered that I really like Beezer’s writing and was deeply craving some fun math puzzles to play with.\nAfter the first few chapters, the systems of linear equations in the book were getting too complicated to perform row-reduction on by hand and I didn’t want to keep relying on the embedded Sage executables that are in the web version of the book (mostly because I found Sage kind of annoying, even if it’s clearly a powerful language). To make it easier to progress through the more challenging practice problems, I decided to try to build a function that takes in a user-specified matrix and performs the classic linear algebra operations to derive the row-reduced echelon form of the matrix. Then I decided that it would be fun and helpful to host my tool in a Shiny app so I could easily access and use it.\nIt’s been fun to dig into a math subject I knew nothing about. It’s very cool that this row-reduced echelon form (RREF) gives extremely apparent insights into a system of linear equations: you can immediately recognize if the system is consistent, whether there’s a unique solution or whether there are infinite solutions, which (if any) variables are dependent or independent, and what the structure to the solution set is – and the RREF can be produced with extremely straightforward computational steps.\n\n\nBut really, why?\nReading through this book has been the first time a text has held my hand through the concept of building mathemetical proofs – there’s a whole section in the back describing proof techniques! I’m really enjoying seeing how one actually thinks through proving a claim, because I’ve always thought of math as being the tools you use to solve a specific problem. Instead, this book is showing that math is a language you can use to describe whole sets of problems and what their solutions look like.\nFor example, using a self-consistent definition of systems of linear equations, you can confidently say that every system of linear equations has one of three classes of solution sets: 1. The system is inconsistent and there is no solution that satisfies every equation. 2. The system is constrained such that there is exactly one solution set that satisfies every equation. 3. The system is unconstrained, and thus there are an infinite number of solutions – and there is a vector form which can describe the form of every one of these solutions.\nI think that’s so cool! I’m less than a quarter of the way through the book and I have no idea if I’ll lose interest at some point soon, but for now this has been fun! At some point I may go back into my Shiny app and expand it so that it produces the vector form of the solution set; it sort of depends on whether I’m having fun writing this out by hand."

    "text": "Assembly\nAs usual, I forgot to take very many pictures while this was a work in progress…\nI started this project by trying to find a way to activate the remote with the ESP32. At first I tried using some input pins on the remote PCB (see the picture below), but I couldn’t get the signal to work properly with these – I think because the voltage going into the “CLK” pinout wasn’t correct.\n\n\n\n\nMy first testing board – not the final wiring schematic\n\n\n\nAfter some testing with a breadboard, I found that the most reliable way to do this was to add a transistor that could close the activation button using a 3.3 V GPIO output signal. Interestingly, I also noticed that this transistor needed an additional load LED going to the ESP32 ground in order to work – which I think suggests that the button typically uses a pull-down resistor?\nMy next step was to start testing the WiFi and MQTT connections so that I could get the ESP32 to publish the door state to my HomeAssistant setup – and to subscribe to a command topic which would allow me to open and close the door on command. I did a lot of testing with the battery removed from the door remote so I didn’t open and close the door 10,000x – instead, I added an extra external button so I could manually trigger the ESP32 to detect an open/close signal. I used the ESP32’s on-board RGB LED as a reporter signal of the WiFi/MQTT connection and the trigger signal (note the bright red signal when I push the button in the video below).\n\n\nAn external button triggers the ESP32 to update an “open”/“closed” boolean which HomeAssistant reads as “Unlocked”/“Locked”. This also works in reverse: triggering a state change in HomeAssistant updates the state onboard the ESP32. However, without an external sensor, the ESP32 has no way to record the real state of the door.\nAn external button triggers the ESP32 to update an “open”/“closed” boolean which HomeAssistant reads as “Unlocked”/“Locked”. This also works in reverse: triggering a state change in HomeAssistant updates the state onboard the ESP32. However, without an external sensor, the ESP32 has no way to record the real state of the door.\n\n\nAdding a Hall effect sensor allows me to detect the true state of the door. I wanted this sensor to be on a long cord so I’d have options on where to mount it – cue me destroying a spare USB-C cable and attaching 3-pin connectors to each end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final ESP32/door remote setup, featuring the can used to build the mount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely not my best work, and it was up on the wall like this for an embarrassingly long time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA little cleaner! Now the board isn’t being suspended from extremely delicate connections that kept breaking! The slightly opaque box also makes the status light look pretty good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI next needed to craft a stable mount for this sensor sit close enough to a magnet on the garage door. I thought very carefully about my options and decided that an aluminum can would be the perfect source material for this mount. I got out my tin snips, a metal ruler, and some super adhesive mounting tape to build a little mount. I then drilled some holes in order to screw the Hall effect sensor to the mount and fixed the whole thing to the wall close enough to my magnet to be triggered when the door is closed.\nFor a good few months I left this little board dangling from the connection cable leading to the Hall effect sensor – a truly janky look. I finally took the time to squeeze it into a little plastic box that kind of obscures the jank and now it looks slightly less like a IED hooked up to the door."

I need to be confident that this little device won’t end up spazzing out and opening the garage door while we’re away.\nMy ideas for this include: using a GeoFence to disable it when I’m away for some amount of time (i.e. reporting my location to HomeAssistant, and putting it into a hard off state) and not actually giving it any of its own automation ability (I had originally wanted it to automatically trigger the door to close after some amount of time, instead I might have it send a push notification to me via HomeAssistant).\nI had a fun round of debugging when the sensor got dislodged and the remote got activated every 2 seconds for the 10+ minutes it took for my wife to come down and unplug it following the first time I left the house after installing the device… The solutions were to find a better spot to mount the sensor and to add a 15 second delay after the trigger function to give the door sufficient time to actually close.\nNew ESPhome yaml: My original iteration was truly too bad to include here.

    "text": "Site structure\nThe Lipid Interactome was built using Quarto, is stored on GitHub, and hosted on Netlify – I apparently have a pretty predictable strategy for building and hosting sites.\n\nData presentation/organization\nBecause several of the studies we’ve included on the site so far have used multiple lipid probes, we decided to split the site into two parts: pages displaying the entire dataset of each individual interactomics study and pages for each lipid probe (with datasets further separated by cell type analyzed). I thought this was valuable because some of the datasets are inherently more comparable – for example, the PA and PE data were collected together as parts of a single larger TMT experiment, as reported by Thomas et al. in 2025.\n\n\nUn-rigorous comparisons\nWhile it isn’t advisable to directly and quantitatively compare datasets collected from different studies, we wanted a way to qualitatively compare different datasets to see broad trends: Are there big overlaps in protein ids? Are the highly enriched proteins in one dataset also enriched in another? To do this, I built a nifty little comparison tool using Shiny which allows the user to select two lipid probes of interest and visualize the log2 fold-change of all proteins identified in each dataset. The cell background of each probe dataset is listed in the user selection to prepare for a future where we have datasets of the same lipid probe but different cell lines.\n\n\nData storage\nThis is a work in progress. I’ve been somewhat careful to describe this site as a data repository or a data aggregation site – because I definitely don’t think this site qualifies as a database just yet. Right now, each page consists of a static HTML page defined by a manually-written Quarto document, which pulls from a folder of .csv files to render the visualizations and allow for user download.\nI would like to eventually get this site closer to a true database, where users are inputting queries for which lipid probe to visualize and under the hood the site pulls the data and renders the page. I don’t think my manual annotation method will work in the future we’re imagining – where there may be a rapid increase in this type of study!\n\n\nData submission\nIn anticipation of a broadened interest in this type of study, we supply a data submission page – this somewhat relies on the data supplier having ratiometric data that aligns with some of my data formatting requirements. These requirements were originally written when I only had a handful of datasets and they all came from the same data pipeline – so all my standardized plotting functions rely on common column headers and data transformations.\nI’ve already repeatedly needed to find my own paths for data wrangling on new datasets that don’t fit neatly in my standardized plotting functions/visualization schemes. For example, Höglinger et al. (2017) used peptide spectral counts to determine selective enrichment to one of three lipid probes – there’s no ratiometric data here! And I can’t really figure out a nice way to present these results alongside ratiometric data…"

Its production is catalyzed by SM synthases SMS1 and SMS2, which interconvert phosphatidylcholine and ceramide to diacylglycerol and SM in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane, respectively. As the lipids participating in this reaction fulfill both structural and signaling functions, SMS enzymes have considerable potential to influence diverse important cellular processes. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model for studying both animal development and human disease. The organism contains five SMS homologues but none of these have been characterized in any detail. Here, we carried out the first systematic analysis of SMS family members in C. elegans. Using heterologous expression systems, genetic ablation, metabolic labeling and lipidome analyses, we show that C. elegans harbors at least three distinct SM synthases and one ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) synthase. Moreover, C. elegans SMS family members have partially overlapping but also unique sub-cellular distributions and together occupy all principal compartments of the secretory pathway. Our findings shed light on crucial aspects of sphingolipid metabolism in a valuable animal model and opens avenues for exploring the role of SM and its metabolic intermediates in organismal development.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Breaking and Entering\n\n\nSphingomyelin Biosynthesis Is Essential for Phagocytic Signaling during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Host Cell Entry\n\n\nPhagocytosis by alveolar macrophages is the obligate first step in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, yet the mechanism underlying this process is incompletely understood. Here we show that Mtb invasion relies on an intact sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition or knockout of early sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes greatly reduces Mtb uptake across multiple phagocytic cell types without affecting other forms of endocytosis. While the phagocytic receptor Dectin-1 undergoes normal clustering at the pathogen contact sites, sphingolipid biosynthetic mutant cells fail to segregate the regulatory phosphatase CD45 from the clustered receptors. Blocking sphingolipid production also impairs downstream activation of Rho GTPases, actin dynamics, and phosphoinositide turnover at the nascent phagocytic cup. Moreover, we find that production of sphingomyelin, not glycosphingolipids, is essential for Mtb uptake. Collectively, our data support a critical role of sphingomyelin biosynthesis in an early stage of Mtb infection and provide novel insights into the mechanism underlying phagocytic entry of this pathogen.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), there is a pressing need for novel and improved therapeutics. Here, we characterize the critical role of sphingolipids in restricting intracellular replication of Mtb. Sphingolipids are essential for rapidly responding to membrane damage and maintaining lysosomal integrity during Mtb infection. Additionally, sphingolipids enable the restriction of Mtb growth within host cells. Understanding the influence of host sphingolipids on Mtb infection may reveal novel routes for host-directed therapy. This research provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of Mtb infection and could pave the way for developing new therapeutic strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Living Off the Fat of the Cell\n\n\nA lipidomics map of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected cell\n\n\nFor centuries, humans have been seeking reliable treatment for tuberculosis, but unfortunately, it still poses a significant threat to global health. Recent research has shown that host lipid biology may offer new opportunities for developing novel antitubercular therapy. Here, we identify unique signatures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection by comparing the global lipidome of cells infected with pathogenic and attenuated Mtb strains against the lipidomes of cells treated with isolated Mtb cell wall components. We find that pathogenic and attenuated infections and treatments with pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce significant upregulation of diacylglycerol production. However, only pathogenic infection increases the production of triacylglycerol and acylcarnitine, reflecting induced fatty acid β-oxidation, while inhibiting the synthesis of lysophospholipids and plasmalogens, which reflects concerted subversions of the macrophage antimicrobial program. This research shows great potential in identifying potential host-directed therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. An Affinity for Sphingolipids\n\n\nTrifunctional lipid probes reveal protein-sphingolipid interactions during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection\n\n\nUnderstanding the molecular interactions underlying Mtb’s capacity for immune subversion and hijacking of the host cell can provide a unique insight into potential new routes of antitubercular therapy. Because Mtb is a pathogen with a unique sensitivity to the host lipid compartment, and because sphingolipids are a lipid family with emerging roles in regulating antimicrobial functions in macrophages, we sought to characterize the sphingolipid interactome of an Mtb-infected cell. To this end, we utilized trifunctionalized lipid analogs as affinity handles for enrichment proteomics. We found that Mtb infection induces a significant reprogramming of proteins that interact with sphingosine. These changes included a downregulation of interactions among proteins involved in secretory trafficking and lysosomal maturation and an upregulation of interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. We further identify a candidate Mtb protein that selectively interacts with trifunctional sphingosine. This analysis is the first of its kind and represents a crucial step in characterizing how sphingolipids mediate the cellular response to intracellular infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Genetic tools to study sphingolipids in disease\n\n\nA review of available methodologies to study the roles of sphingolipids in viral infections.\n\n\nSphingolipids are a critical family of membrane lipids with diverse functions in eukaryotic cells, and a growing body of literature supports that these lipids play essential roles during the lifecycles of viruses. While small molecule inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis and metabolism are widely used, the advent of CRISPR-based genomic editing techniques allows for nuanced exploration into the manners in which sphingolipids influence various stages of viral infections. Here we describe some of these critical considerations needed in designing studies utilizing genomic editing techniques for manipulating the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, as well as the current body of literature regarding how viruses depend on the products of this pathway. Here, we highlight the ways in which sphingolipids affect viruses as these pathogens interact with and influence their host cell and describe some of the many open questions remaining in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. The Squeaky Yeast Gets Greased\n\n\nThe Roles of Host Lipids in the Clearance of Pathogenic Fungi\n\n\nFungal infections remain a global health threat with high morbidity and mortality. The human immune system must, therefore, perpetually defend against invasive fungal infections. Phagocytosis is critical for the clearance of fungal pathogens, as this cellular process allows select immune cells to internalize and destroy invading fungal cells. While much is known about the protein players that enable phagocytosis, the various roles that lipids play during this fundamental innate immune process are still being illuminated. In this review, we describe recent discoveries that shed new light on the mechanisms by which host lipids enable the phagocytic uptake and clearance of fungal pathogens.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Rapid visualization and quantification of phagocytosis in neutrophils\n\n\nA protocol for using high-content fluorescence microscopy to quantify phagocytosis.\n\n\nPhagocytosis by phagocytes such as neutrophils is a crucial part of the host innate immune response against invading pathogens. Phagocytosis is a complex process that initiates with the binding of the particles on the cell surface of the phagocytes through the interaction of pattern recognition receptors with ligands on the surface of the pathogens. During this process, phagocytes undergo extensive membrane reorganization and cytoskeleton rearrangement at their cell surface. To gain better insight about the molecular mechanisms of this dynamic cellular process, visualization and quantification in a high-throughput manner is essential. Here, we describe a microscope-based method to visualize and quantify phagocytic uptake of pathogens (such as bacteria and fungi) and model particulates that are larger than 0.5 μm (such as Zymosan A and IgG-coated beads).\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation\n\n\n\n\n\nMy dissertation is free to view online – all 300 pages of it!

TB & The Sphinx\n\n\nA technical review of sphingolipids as a target of host directed therapies for treating Tuberculosis disease.\n\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a significant cause of infectious death worldwide. This intracellular pathogen uses many mechanisms to subvert the host immune system and lie undetected before causing active disease. This subtle pathogen is uniquely dependent on host lipids for energy, production of host-damaging materiel, and immune subversion. In the face of antibiotic-resistant Mtb strains, researchers have turned toward lipid biology for potential avenues of novel antitubercular therapy. The sphingolipid family has gained attention for its profound roles in determining cell fate, immune signaling, and antimicrobial activity. We review the state of the field regarding sphingolipids as candidate targets of host-directed antitubercular intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.

Using heterologous expression systems, genetic ablation, metabolic labeling and lipidome analyses, we show that C. elegans harbors at least three distinct SM synthases and one ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) synthase. Moreover, C. elegans SMS family members have partially overlapping but also unique sub-cellular distributions and together occupy all principal compartments of the secretory pathway. Our findings shed light on crucial aspects of sphingolipid metabolism in a valuable animal model and opens avenues for exploring the role of SM and its metabolic intermediates in organismal development.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. TB & The Sphinx\n\n\nA technical review of sphingolipids as a target of host directed therapies for treating Tuberculosis disease.\n\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a significant cause of infectious death worldwide. This intracellular pathogen uses many mechanisms to subvert the host immune system and lie undetected before causing active disease. This subtle pathogen is uniquely dependent on host lipids for energy, production of host-damaging materiel, and immune subversion. In the face of antibiotic-resistant Mtb strains, researchers have turned toward lipid biology for potential avenues of novel antitubercular therapy. The sphingolipid family has gained attention for its profound roles in determining cell fate, immune signaling, and antimicrobial activity. We review the state of the field regarding sphingolipids as candidate targets of host-directed antitubercular intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Breaking and Entering\n\n\nSphingomyelin Biosynthesis Is Essential for Phagocytic Signaling during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Host Cell Entry\n\n\nPhagocytosis by alveolar macrophages is the obligate first step in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, yet the mechanism underlying this process is incompletely understood. Here we show that Mtb invasion relies on an intact sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition or knockout of early sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes greatly reduces Mtb uptake across multiple phagocytic cell types without affecting other forms of endocytosis. While the phagocytic receptor Dectin-1 undergoes normal clustering at the pathogen contact sites, sphingolipid biosynthetic mutant cells fail to segregate the regulatory phosphatase CD45 from the clustered receptors. Blocking sphingolipid production also impairs downstream activation of Rho GTPases, actin dynamics, and phosphoinositide turnover at the nascent phagocytic cup. Moreover, we find that production of sphingomyelin, not glycosphingolipids, is essential for Mtb uptake. Collectively, our data support a critical role of sphingomyelin biosynthesis in an early stage of Mtb infection and provide novel insights into the mechanism underlying phagocytic entry of this pathogen.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Sealing the Gaps\n\n\nSphingolipids are essential for repairing the endosomal damage caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\n\nTuberculosis infection remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, causing over 1.3 million deaths in 2022 alone. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), there is a pressing need for novel and improved therapeutics. Here, we characterize the critical role of sphingolipids in restricting intracellular replication of Mtb. Sphingolipids are essential for rapidly responding to membrane damage and maintaining lysosomal integrity during Mtb infection. Additionally, sphingolipids enable the restriction of Mtb growth within host cells. Understanding the influence of host sphingolipids on Mtb infection may reveal novel routes for host-directed therapy. This research provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of Mtb infection and could pave the way for developing new therapeutic strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. An Affinity for Sphingolipids\n\n\nTrifunctional lipid probes reveal protein-sphingolipid interactions during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection\n\n\nUnderstanding the molecular interactions underlying Mtb’s capacity for immune subversion and hijacking of the host cell can provide a unique insight into potential new routes of antitubercular therapy. Because Mtb is a pathogen with a unique sensitivity to the host lipid compartment, and because sphingolipids are a lipid family with emerging roles in regulating antimicrobial functions in macrophages, we sought to characterize the sphingolipid interactome of an Mtb-infected cell. To this end, we utilized trifunctionalized lipid analogs as affinity handles for enrichment proteomics. We found that Mtb infection induces a significant reprogramming of proteins that interact with sphingosine. These changes included a downregulation of interactions among proteins involved in secretory trafficking and lysosomal maturation and an upregulation of interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. We further identify a candidate Mtb protein that selectively interacts with trifunctional sphingosine. This analysis is the first of its kind and represents a crucial step in characterizing how sphingolipids mediate the cellular response to intracellular infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Genetic tools to study sphingolipids in disease\n\n\nA review of available methodologies to study the roles of sphingolipids in viral infections.\n\n\nSphingolipids are a critical family of membrane lipids with diverse functions in eukaryotic cells, and a growing body of literature supports that these lipids play essential roles during the lifecycles of viruses. While small molecule inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis and metabolism are widely used, the advent of CRISPR-based genomic editing techniques allows for nuanced exploration into the manners in which sphingolipids influence various stages of viral infections. Here we describe some of these critical considerations needed in designing studies utilizing genomic editing techniques for manipulating the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, as well as the current body of literature regarding how viruses depend on the products of this pathway. Here, we highlight the ways in which sphingolipids affect viruses as these pathogens interact with and influence their host cell and describe some of the many open questions remaining in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.

Rapid visualization and quantification of phagocytosis in neutrophils\n\n\nA protocol for using high-content fluorescence microscopy to quantify phagocytosis.\n\n\nPhagocytosis by phagocytes such as neutrophils is a crucial part of the host innate immune response against invading pathogens. Phagocytosis is a complex process that initiates with the binding of the particles on the cell surface of the phagocytes through the interaction of pattern recognition receptors with ligands on the surface of the pathogens. During this process, phagocytes undergo extensive membrane reorganization and cytoskeleton rearrangement at their cell surface. To gain better insight about the molecular mechanisms of this dynamic cellular process, visualization and quantification in a high-throughput manner is essential. Here, we describe a microscope-based method to visualize and quantify phagocytic uptake of pathogens (such as bacteria and fungi) and model particulates that are larger than 0.5 μm (such as Zymosan A and IgG-coated beads).\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation\n\n\n\n\n\nMy dissertation is free to view online – all 300 pages of it!

Living Off the Fat of the Cell\n\n\nA lipidomics map of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected cell\n\n\nFor centuries, humans have been seeking reliable treatment for tuberculosis, but unfortunately, it still poses a significant threat to global health. Recent research has shown that host lipid biology may offer new opportunities for developing novel antitubercular therapy. Here, we identify unique signatures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection by comparing the global lipidome of cells infected with pathogenic and attenuated Mtb strains against the lipidomes of cells treated with isolated Mtb cell wall components. We find that pathogenic and attenuated infections and treatments with pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce significant upregulation of diacylglycerol production. However, only pathogenic infection increases the production of triacylglycerol and acylcarnitine, reflecting induced fatty acid β-oxidation, while inhibiting the synthesis of lysophospholipids and plasmalogens, which reflects concerted subversions of the macrophage antimicrobial program. This research shows great potential in identifying potential host-directed therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.
