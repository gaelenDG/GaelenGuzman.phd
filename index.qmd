:::{#hero-heading}
## Hello!

I am a postdoctoral researcher with Dr. Fikadu Tafesse at Oregon Health & Science University. I study microbiology and lipid biology -- focusing on the manners in which host lipids influence the progression of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection. Check out some of my research above!

I'm interested in a career in scientific communication and data science: I want to promote public health and open science by building a stronger bridge between scientists and the public. I'm looking for a new position as my postdoc is wrapping up, so feel free to check out my resume above for more details about my skills and experience -- some are listed below too.

I'm also a new father, so I don't exactly have a lot of free time -- but when I do, I enjoy hobby electrical engineering projects (see some of my projects above!), rock climbing, cycling, and enjoying those Pacific Northwest outdoors.

Please reach out, I'd love to chat!
