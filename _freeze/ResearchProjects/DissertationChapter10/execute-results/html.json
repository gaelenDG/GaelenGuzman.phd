Systematic analysis of the sphingomyelin synthase family in *C. elegans*\"\nsubtitle: \"The identification and characterization of a family of sphingomyelin synthases in *C. elegans* nematodes.\"\ndescription: \"Sphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of mammalian cell membranes and particularly abundant in the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. Its production is catalyzed by SM synthases SMS1 and SMS2, which interconvert phosphatidylcholine and ceramide to diacylglycerol and SM in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane, respectively. As the lipids participating in this reaction fulfill both structural and signaling functions, SMS enzymes have considerable potential to influence diverse important cellular processes. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model for studying both animal development and human disease. The organism contains five SMS homologues but none of these have been characterized in any detail. Here, we carried out the first systematic analysis of SMS family members in C. elegans. Using heterologous expression systems, genetic ablation, metabolic labeling and lipidome analyses, we show that C. elegans harbors at least three distinct SM synthases and one ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) synthase. Moreover, C. elegans SMS family members have partially overlapping but also unique sub-cellular distributions and together occupy all principal compartments of the secretory pathway. Our findings shed light on crucial aspects of sphingolipid metabolism in a valuable animal model and opens avenues for exploring the role of SM and its metabolic intermediates in organismal development.\"\ndate: 2024-02-19\nimage: Images/Chapter10.png\nlisting: true  # Ensure it appears in the listing\nengine: knitr  # Prevents Quarto from processing content\nfreeze: true  # Avoid re-rendering issues\nexternal-url: https://guzmangadissertation.netlify.app/parts/addenda/addenda_celegans_sms_family\n---\n\n\n\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0;url=https://guzmangadissertation.netlify.app/parts/addenda/addenda_celegans_sms_family\">\n\n[Click here if you are not redirected!](https://guzmangadissertation.netlify.app/parts/addenda/addenda_celegans_sms_family)\n",
