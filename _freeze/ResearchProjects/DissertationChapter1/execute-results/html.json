We aim to convey how one niche class of human lipids, sphingolipids, may affect the course of a *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (*Mtb*) infection. We introduce TB, its historical context, and the evolution of mycobacteria alongside humans. We also introduce the crucial and enigmatic roles of sphingolipids throughout human biology and how they may present novel ways of treating TB infections. These historical contexts are essential for a deeper discussion on the interplay between *Mtb* infection and the lipids in the host cell. Further, it is necessary for individuals attempting to discover potential tuberculosis treatments to consider the diseaseâ€™s historical background. A low-cost, effective therapy is a crucial first step in rectifying the long-standing systemic injustices of tuberculosis treatment.\"\ndate: 2024-02-19\nimage: Images/DissertationPreview.png\nlisting: true  # Ensure it appears in the listing\nengine: knitr  # Prevents Quarto from processing content\nfreeze: true  # Avoid re-rendering issues\nexternal-url: https://guzmangadissertation.netlify.app/parts/introduction/intro_layperson\n---\n\n\n\n\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0;url=https://guzmangadissertation.netlify.app/parts/introduction/intro_layperson\">\n\n[Click here if you are not redirected!](https://guzmangadissertation.netlify.app/parts/introduction/intro_layperson)\n",
