Recent research has shown that host lipid biology may offer new opportunities for developing novel antitubercular therapy. Here, we identify unique signatures of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (*Mtb*) infection by comparing the global lipidome of cells infected with pathogenic and attenuated *Mtb* strains against the lipidomes of cells treated with isolated *Mtb* cell wall components. We find that pathogenic and attenuated infections and treatments with pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce significant upregulation of diacylglycerol production. However, only pathogenic infection increases the production of triacylglycerol and acylcarnitine, reflecting induced fatty acid Î²-oxidation, while inhibiting the synthesis of lysophospholipids and plasmalogens, which reflects concerted subversions of the macrophage antimicrobial program. This research shows great potential in identifying potential host-directed therapies.\"\ndate: 2024-02-19\nimage: Images/Chapter5.png\nlisting: true  # Ensure it appears in the listing\nengine: knitr  # Prevents Quarto from processing content\nfreeze: true  # Avoid re-rendering issues\nexternal-url: https://guzmangadissertation.netlify.app/parts/results/results_mtb_lipidomics_v2\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0;url=https://guzmangadissertation.netlify.app/parts/results/results_mtb_lipidomics_v2\">\n\n[Click here if you are not redirected!](https://guzmangadissertation.netlify.app/parts/results/results_mtb_lipidomics_v2)\n",
