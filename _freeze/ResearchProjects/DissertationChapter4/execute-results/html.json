With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (*Mtb*), there is a pressing need for novel and improved therapeutics. Here, we characterize the critical role of sphingolipids in restricting intracellular replication of Mtb. Sphingolipids are essential for rapidly responding to membrane damage and maintaining lysosomal integrity during *Mtb* infection. Additionally, sphingolipids enable the restriction of *Mtb* growth within host cells. Understanding the influence of host sphingolipids on *Mtb* infection may reveal novel routes for host-directed therapy. This research provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of *Mtb* infection and could pave the way for developing new therapeutic strategies.\"\ndate: 2024-02-19\nimage: Images/Chapter4.png\nlisting: true  # Ensure it appears in the listing\nengine: knitr  # Prevents Quarto from processing content\nfreeze: true  # Avoid re-rendering issues\nexternal-url: https://guzmangadissertation.netlify.app/parts/results/results_mtb_membrane_damage_v2\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0;url=https://guzmangadissertation.netlify.app/parts/results/results_mtb_membrane_damage_v2\">\n\n[Click here if you are not redirected!](https://guzmangadissertation.netlify.app/parts/results/results_mtb_membrane_damage_v2)\n",
