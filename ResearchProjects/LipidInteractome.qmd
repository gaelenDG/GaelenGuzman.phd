title: The Lipid Interactome
description: The **Lipid Interactome** is an interactive, centralized resource designed to harmonize, compare, and integrate lipid interactome datasets. It adheres to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles, ensuring that lipidâ€“protein interaction data is systematically organized and easily accessible to researchers. By consolidating proteomics data from multifunctional lipid probes, this resource facilitates the systematic study of lipid-binding proteins across different lipid species and cellular models.
