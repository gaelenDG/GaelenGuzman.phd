title: The Lipid Interactome
description: This interactive web tool aggregates the data from a number of publications which utilize synthetic, functionalized lipid analogs to do affinity enrichment in order to identify the protein interactors of select bioactive lipids.

## Overview

The **Lipid Interactome** is an interactive, centralized resource designed to harmonize, compare, and integrate lipid interactome datasets. It adheres to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles, ensuring that lipidâ€“protein interaction data is systematically organized and easily accessible to researchers. By consolidating proteomics data from multifunctional lipid probes, this resource facilitates the systematic study of lipid-binding proteins across different lipid species and cellular models.

I built this repository with the guidance of Dr. Fikadu Tafesse and Dr. Carsten Schultz in order to make these data more accessible and reusable -- hopefully it can help lipid researchers select candidate proteins for analyzing the functional roles of lipids.

## Site structure

The Lipid Interactome was built using Quarto, is stored on GitHub, and hosted on Netlify -- I apparently have a pretty predictable strategy for building and hosting sites.
