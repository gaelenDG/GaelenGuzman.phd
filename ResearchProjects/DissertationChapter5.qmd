title: "5. Living Off the Fat of the Cell"
subtitle: "A lipidomics map of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected cell"
description: "For centuries, humans have been seeking reliable treatment for tuberculosis, but unfortunately, it still poses a significant threat to global health. Recent research has shown that host lipid biology may offer new opportunities for developing novel antitubercular therapy. Here, we identify unique signatures of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (*Mtb*) infection by comparing the global lipidome of cells infected with pathogenic and attenuated *Mtb* strains against the lipidomes of cells treated with isolated *Mtb* cell wall components. We find that pathogenic and attenuated infections and treatments with pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce significant upregulation of diacylglycerol production. However, only pathogenic infection increases the production of triacylglycerol and acylcarnitine, reflecting induced fatty acid Î²-oxidation, while inhibiting the synthesis of lysophospholipids and plasmalogens, which reflects concerted subversions of the macrophage antimicrobial program. This research shows great potential in identifying potential host-directed therapies."
