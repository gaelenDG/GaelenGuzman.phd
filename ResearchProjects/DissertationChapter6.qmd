subtitle: "An Affinity for Sphingolipids: Trifunctional lipid probes reveal protein-sphingolipid interactions during *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection"
description: "Understanding the molecular interactions underlying Mtbâ€™s capacity for immune subversion and hijacking of the host cell can provide a unique insight into potential new routes of antitubercular therapy. Because *Mtb* is a pathogen with a unique sensitivity to the host lipid compartment, and because sphingolipids are a lipid family with emerging roles in regulating antimicrobial functions in macrophages, we sought to characterize the sphingolipid interactome of an Mtb-infected cell. To this end, we utilized trifunctionalized lipid analogs as affinity handles for enrichment proteomics. We found that *Mtb* infection induces a significant reprogramming of proteins that interact with sphingosine. These changes included a downregulation of interactions among proteins involved in secretory trafficking and lysosomal maturation and an upregulation of interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. We further identify a candidate *Mtb* protein that selectively interacts with trifunctional sphingosine. This analysis is the first of its kind and represents a crucial step in characterizing how sphingolipids mediate the cellular response to intracellular infection."
