## Overview

This baby book houses an ESP32, 24 NeoPixels, and some light-dependent resistors to make for a fun light-up addition to a children's story! 

I started working on this about 4 months ago, with long pauses. I recently revisited the code to refactor and reorganize things -- a big part of why this project was sitting idle was that the code was so unreadable that I couldn't get myself to work on it.

The story is still a work in progress, so check back soon and hopefully I will have more updates!

## Materials, Components, & Tools

* Cardstock (varying thicknesses)
* An ESP32c3 supermini microcontroller
* A 74AHCT125 level shifter (to convert the 3.3 V data out to 5 V)
* 5x light-dependent resistors (LDR)
* A 10 k&ohm; pull-up resistor for the LDRs
* 2x 470 &ohm; resistors (for the NeoPixel data lines)
* A 5 mm hole punch
* A crafting knife
* Super glue
