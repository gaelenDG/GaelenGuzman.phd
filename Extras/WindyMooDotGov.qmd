## Getting in our house

Welcome to our home! 

The code to the kitchen door and garage are the same: **0824**.

## How to Leave the House

Here's my handy-dandy checklist, tick things off as you go (a lot of these things just live in the big embarrassing ironman bag):

- [ ] Big embarrassing ironman bag
- [ ] Fanny pack diaper bag -- filled with diapers & wipes
- [ ] 2-3 Small toys (rattle or stuffed animal)
- [ ] Formula in mini cooler (1-2 bottles, 6-12 oz formula)
- [ ] Some solid foods (banana, applesauce pouch, yogurt, etc.)
- [ ] Change of clothes
- [ ] Baby sunscreen
- [ ] Sun hat

## Basic Daily Schedule

Big W is a freeform child and defies predictability. This is, at best, an estimate for what a typical day is like. Now that I write it down, it's likely to drastically change, as he likes to keep everyone on their toes.

The wake windows are highlighted in bold, and the total amount of time he's awake is usually pretty consistent.

- **6:30 am** -- Quick morning snack before returning to slumber
- **9:00 am** -- Up for real this time! **He'll only be up for 2 hrs, precisely!** Likes morning playtime and a real food meal (oatmeal, yogurt, berries)
- **11:00 am** -- First "real" nap. Usually pretty close to 90 mins, though frequently anywhere between 45 - 120 mins.
- **12:30 pm** -- Second wake window! **He'll be awake for 2.5 - 3 hrs.** I like to try to get out of the house for this one -- maybe a park or a longer walk. Make sure to bring some food, he really doesn't drink formula out and about anymore.
- **3:30 pm** -- Second nap. Length usually depends on how long the first one was -- they typically add up to about 3 hrs total (i.e. if the first was 90 mins, the second will also be 90 mins)
- **5:00 pm** -- Last wake window! **He'll be up til bedtime.** We like to give him some backyard/pool time and a big dinner: this is where he's most interested in savory foods -- he'll happily eat whatever you're eating, lol. Consider bath time near the end of this window if he's gotten a lot of food all over.
- **7:45 pm** -- Bedtime routine! See below.
- **8:00 pm** -- Bedtime. He's almost always completely tuckered out and ready for bed precisely at 8.

## Bedtime & Pre-Nap Routine

This guy's gotten used to a straightforward pre-sleep routine down in the basement. I like to do all this with the lights off and either quietly chatting with him or singing:

- Fresh diaper (stored in the funny tv stand in the basement, changing pad on the floor)
- Get into sleep sack (usually hanging in the opening to the pack 'n play)
- Bottle of formula (he rarely drinks it all, but I usually like to bring 6 oz down with me)
- Usually he'll either signal that he's done drinking (shaking his head, waving the bottle away) or start to get too sleepy to continue eating (I usually save whatever's left in the bottle for 15-20 mins, just in case he has trouble falling asleep)
- Plop him into the pack 'n play and zip the tent shut
- Make sure the white noise machine is on (it usually is, but you just have to tap the metal ring on the top of the Hatch to start it)

**When to intervene:** Sometimes this guy is just too wound up or too tired to fall asleep, and he'll complain/yell for a few minutes. If he's really upset (actually screaming) or if it's been more than ~15 minutes, I'd go down there to check on him -- sometimes he'll realize he's still hungry once he's in his tent, other times he has a big burp, and other other times he'll need a new diaper before going to sleep. I usually bring ~2 oz of formula down with me and check if he's interested.

~~**Big heads up:** The sound has been unpredictable on the baby monitor for a few weeks now -- you may need to actively check every once in a while by looking at the screen or listening for him from the door upstairs. We're trying to figure out what's wrong with it, so hopefully you won't have to deal with this.~~

**Baby monitor update:** The microphone is now totally dead in the baby monitor... So I made one! There are a few ways to access the audio stream:

1. As long as you're on our WiFi, you can go to this link on any device: <http://192.168.0.42:8000/babyroom.mp3>. I recommend checking that the stream is still playing every once in a while -- my phone likes to shut it off frequently...

2. You can also use the Home Assistant app on the really shitty purple tablet -- when you open the app it should be the first view available, just press play and make sure the volume is up. 
    - This thing is a piece of trash lol, so if it isn't working you can try to restart the HA app. 
    - If it's still still not working, try opening the Tailscale app and see if it says "Connected" at the top (If the battery died, you'll need to do this also!).
    - Sometimes this thing just doesn't work and it defies all logic, just give up and use the link above on a different device.

3. You can hear him from pretty much anywhere in the house once he starts yelling, don't panic if the tablet isn't working and link above is broken, you'll definitely hear him if you're inside!

## Feeding Instructions

### Bottles and Formula

Bottles are mostly a pre-bedtime snack, he seems to not like them when it's not time to go to sleep lol.

Formula will usually be pre-mixed in the fridge -- if I've forgotten to prep it for you or it runs out, we use the water heater  (by the espresso machine) to bring the water up to 40&deg;C and then mix in the formula powder (in the cabinet above the espresso machine).

- For every 2 oz of water, add 1 scoop of formula powder.
- I usually make a big batch of 20 oz + 10 scoops of formula, usually enough for about a day. 
- Feel free to use the scale: 1 oz water = 29 grams, 1 scoop formula = 8.6 grams.

Washing bottles is easy, just rinse them and use the bottle brush with dish soap to scrub them out. There will probably be a bunch of clean bottles in or near the drying rack -- feel free to leave used bottles to soak in soapy water for us to wash them in a big batch!

### Solid Foods

This guy likes to eat. Our main resource for serving safe solid foods is the [Solid Starts app](https://www.solidstarts.com/app/). It has a lot of great information about what foods are safe for babies, how to prepare them, and how to serve them.

There are only a few no-gos right now, and they include:

- Honey
- Cured/deli meats
- Crunchy/hard things
- Added sugar
- Trachea shaped (un-squished berries, whole grapes, whole cherry tomatoes, etc.)

We prefer that he either eats solid foods while sitting in his high chair or sitting fully upright -- laying back in his car seat is not ideal due to choking risk.

We will have (ideally) prepped a little container of easy snack foods in the fridge. Usually this will be some combination of:

- Yogurt
- Hummus
- Applesauce
- Oatmeal
- Nut butter (peanut, almond, sunflower, etc)
- Soft fruits (banana, avocado, berries, etc)

If we forgot to prep food for you, or if he's eaten everything we prepped, feel free to rummage in the fridge for more things! He'll pretty much eat anything we give him! 

## Bath Time

This man gets gross pretty frequently, especially while eating. If he's narsty, feel free to either give him a sink bath or a pool bath in the back yard. In either case, it's super important to keep an eye on him and keep the water level pretty shallow (3-4 inches max). 

**Sink:** For a sink bath, just make sure the sink is relatively clean and skootch anything he could grab out of his way (knives & dishes on the drying rack, sponges, dish soap, etc). Fill the sink with a few inches of comfortably warm water. **WARNING: THE WATER CAN GET VERY VERY HOT**. He's extremely interested in playing with the sink handle, so we like to give him some bath toys to keep his hands occupied. 

**Pool:** In most ways this is easier than the sink because somehow he doesn't mind cold water? Just make sure it's not like really really cold and that he doesn't eat any sticks/leaves/bugs that fell in.

## Car & Car Seat Instructions

You are extremely welcome to use our car for some adventures with the little guy! We'll probably go over this with you in person, but here are some reminders & resources about how the car seat works.

**I highly recommend turning the car on for a few minutes before putting W in his seat -- the car just gets too hot!** We'll also make sure there's a small fan in the back too, to help get the AC to him.

I thought about writing a thing about how to use the car seat and then I realized it would be so much easier to just link to a video. So here it is -- check this out if we forgot to show you how to use the car seat or if you want a reminder!
