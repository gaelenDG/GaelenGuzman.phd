## Getting in our house

Welcome to our home! 

The code to the kitchen door and garage are the same: **0824**.


## Leaving the house

Here's my handy-dandy checklist, tick things off as you go (a lot of these things just live in the big embarrassing ironman bag):

- [ ] Big embarrassing ironman bag
- [ ] Fanny pack diaper bag -- filled with diapers & wipes
- [ ] 2-3 Small toys (rattle or stuffed animal)
- [ ] Solid foods (yogurt & berries, banana, applesauce pouch, etc.)
- [ ] Change of clothes
- [ ] Baby sunscreen
- [ ] Sun hat
- [ ] Rain jacket / rain pants

## Daily schedule

Wendell at 13 months still defies the shackles of temporal constraints. This tiny guy likes to fall into patterns just to lull you into a false sense of security. Rely this schedule at your own peril.

- **6:30 am** -- Up and at em! Usually wakes up hungry, see below for mealtime tips.

- **10:00 am** -- Probably ready for his first nap. We've still been doing some formula before sleeping, and it's a judgement call about bottle vs sippy cup.

- **11:30 am** -- Up again! Ready to party and will wanna get out of the house. Make sure to bring some snacks with you!

- **2:00 pm** -- Nap #2! 

- **3:45 pm** -- 

- **5:00 pm** -- It's insane, but this is the time to make a judgement call: does he seem like he's gonna make it to bedtime? If he's already grumpy and scream-y, it may be good to chuck him in his bed for a mini nap. Think 15-30 mins, not past 6:00 pm!

- **6:00 pm** -- Dinner time! He's usually hungry for something more savory here; he likes real dinner food like pasta or rice or veggies :)

- **7:30 pm** -- Time to start winding down and getting ready for bed -- see below for bedtime routine.

- **8:00 pm** -- Bedtime!

## Car & Car Seat Instructions

You are extremely welcome to use our car for some adventures with the little guy! We'll probably go over this with you in person, but here are some reminders & resources about how the car seat works.

**I highly recommend turning the car on for a few minutes before putting W in his seat -- the car just gets too hot!** We'll also make sure there's a small fan in the back too, to help get the AC to him.

### The Car Seat -- Graco Extend2Fit

**The instructions manual is stored in the little slot underneath the seat! Check here if anything feels off.**

I thought about writing a thing about how to use the car seat and then I realized it would be so much easier to just link to a video. So here it is -- check this out if we forgot to show you how to use the car seat or if you want a reminder!
